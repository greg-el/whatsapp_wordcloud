12/10/2016, 23:17 - Will Green: Amazon
12/10/2016, 23:17 - Will Green: I've thought of so many things
12/10/2016, 23:17 - Will Green: And this seems the most feasible
12/10/2016, 23:17 - Greg: How
12/10/2016, 23:17 - Greg: How is a bright yellow suit and hat the most feasible
12/10/2016, 23:18 - Greg: What the heck else have you been coming up with
12/10/2016, 23:18 - Will Green: Because you have to think of characters
12/10/2016, 23:18 - Will Green: Not outfits
12/10/2016, 23:18 - Will Green: Like people we actually like
12/10/2016, 23:19 - Will Green: And can get away with dressing up as
12/10/2016, 23:20 - Greg: Consume more pop culture
12/10/2016, 23:20 - Greg: go dressed as aaron
12/10/2016, 23:20 - Greg: I'll be gabe
12/10/2016, 23:23 - Will Green: Ffs
12/10/2016, 23:23 - Will Green: I have too much chin
12/10/2016, 23:23 - Will Green: And nobody would get it
12/10/2016, 23:23 - Will Green: What about lance and Aaron
12/10/2016, 23:23 - Will Green: You go as Aaron
12/10/2016, 23:24 - Greg: That would never work
12/10/2016, 23:24 - Greg: U fool

12/10/2016, 23:24 - Greg: I can be papa franku
12/10/2016, 23:51 - Will Green: I was gunna go as man spider
12/10/2016, 23:51 - Will Green: But I feel like it would be a lost reference
12/10/2016, 23:53 - Greg: Nah that's more of a marvel reference
12/10/2016, 23:54 - Greg: if you want a lost reference go as hurley
13/10/2016, 03:48 - Will Green: I don't even know who that is
14/10/2016, 13:51 - Will Green: So you want to buy my old wheels
14/10/2016, 13:51 - Will Green: They're too bouncy to land anything
14/10/2016, 13:51 - Will Green: Fine for cruising
14/10/2016, 13:51 - Will Green: And not looking "lame"
14/10/2016, 14:02 - Greg: Nigga I'm in no position to buy anything
14/10/2016, 14:42 - Greg: Also too bouncy to land anything isn't a great selling point
14/10/2016, 14:57 - Will Green: Just thought I'd be honest
14/10/2016, 14:58 - Will Green: I got some cheap hard wheels and I've actually managed to land a few things without rolling incredibly fast or losing the board under my feet as it bounces
14/10/2016, 14:58 - Will Green: Gunna try finally land a strawberry milkshake later
14/10/2016, 15:12 - Greg: Good luck bruh
14/10/2016, 15:12 - Greg: What level of hard are those wheels
14/10/2016, 15:13 - Greg: What did you land
14/10/2016, 15:23 - Will Green: i landed this weird dismount finger flip thing i found on utube
14/10/2016, 15:23 - Will Green: you know that guy who was skating around last time we went there
14/10/2016, 15:24 - Will Green: he kept like ollie, jumping off the board, flipping it and jumping back on?
14/10/2016, 15:24 - Will Green: it's like that
14/10/2016, 15:24 - Will Green: but it's impossible to do if you've got soft wheels cause it bounces all over the place
14/10/2016, 15:26 - Will Green: and the wheels are 99a
14/10/2016, 15:26 - Will Green: so they're like wheels for actually doing tricks
14/10/2016, 15:26 - Will Green: horrible to cruise on
14/10/2016, 15:27 - Greg: eh
14/10/2016, 15:27 - Greg: U just said they were good for cruising
14/10/2016, 15:29 - Will Green: i'm talking about the ones i that i just got
14/10/2016, 15:29 - Will Green: not the soft ones
14/10/2016, 15:29 - Will Green: the soft ones are great for cruising
14/10/2016, 15:29 - Will Green: they're like 40a though
14/10/2016, 15:30 - Greg: oh right I glossed over that completely
14/10/2016, 15:35 - Greg: does it roll like mine now
14/10/2016, 15:51 - Will Green: not quite that bad
14/10/2016, 15:51 - Will Green: somewhere in the middle
14/10/2016, 15:52 - Greg: sounds pretty gooood
14/10/2016, 15:54 - Will Green: yeah it's decent
14/10/2016, 15:54 - Will Green: i wish i had the balls to commit to stuf
14/10/2016, 15:54 - Will Green: think i could probably land a varial
14/10/2016, 16:00 - Greg: can you ollie yet
14/10/2016, 16:02 - Will Green: yeah
14/10/2016, 16:02 - Will Green: not while rolling
14/10/2016, 16:08 - Greg: get drunk and skate
14/10/2016, 16:08 - Greg: then youll be fearless
14/10/2016, 16:09 - Will Green: that sounds like a terrible idea
14/10/2016, 16:09 - Greg: nah
14/10/2016, 16:09 - Greg: what could go wrong
14/10/2016, 16:10 - Greg: i might try and get that 5050 down on that bit
14/10/2016, 16:10 - Greg: how hard can it be
14/10/2016, 16:10 - Will Green: what bit?
14/10/2016, 16:10 - Will Green: oh
14/10/2016, 16:11 - Will Green: i know what you mean
14/10/2016, 16:11 - Greg: its even got the babies first grind bit on it
14/10/2016, 16:12 - Will Green: huh
14/10/2016, 16:12 - Will Green: you'll need some wax
14/10/2016, 16:12 - Will Green: lol
14/10/2016, 16:13 - Will Green: i took the risers off my trucks and it's so much easier to maintain balance on two wheels
14/10/2016, 16:14 - Greg: interesting
14/10/2016, 16:14 - Greg: i wouldnt have thought it would make much difference
14/10/2016, 16:16 - Will Green: i read something about having low trucks
14/10/2016, 16:16 - Will Green: and it said that it lowers your centre of gravity
14/10/2016, 16:16 - Will Green: which makes it easier to land tricks and to manual
14/10/2016, 16:18 - Greg: its only like
14/10/2016, 16:18 - Greg: a cm difference at most though
14/10/2016, 16:18 - Will Green: quarter of an inch
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Greg: oh wow
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Will Green: apparently it's why some pros have low trucks
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Greg: even less
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Will Green: i can't see that it would make any difference at our level thouggh
14/10/2016, 16:20 - Greg: nah
14/10/2016, 16:20 - Greg: just learn the stuff without worryig about it
14/10/2016, 16:20 - Greg: then
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Will Green: i guess if you had like 50mm wheels like all the people on sls have
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Will Green: and like
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Will Green: no risers
14/10/2016, 16:19 - Will Green: and super low trucks
14/10/2016, 16:20 - Will Green: the deck would be really low to the ground
14/10/2016, 16:20 - Greg: if it is easier youll be mad sick on lows
14/10/2016, 16:22 - Will Green: Tru
14/10/2016, 16:22 - Will Green: I got a pair of those painkiller socks on eBay (new) for like £8
14/10/2016, 16:22 - Will Green: And I haven't had bruised ankles since

05/12/2016, 00:54 - Greg: Well maybe
05/12/2016, 00:54 - Greg: Probably not

18/12/2016, 19:29 - Will Green: How many likes you get?
18/12/2016, 19:29 - Will Green: It's when Jeremy is trying to ask Ben's girlfriend to fuck him without him asking her directly
18/12/2016, 19:29 - Will Green: So he makes up a story called baseball man
18/12/2016, 19:29 - Will Green: Where the main character is in his position
18/12/2016, 19:29 - Will Green: And asks her what he thinks baseball man should do
18/12/2016, 19:35 - Greg: 55
18/12/2016, 19:47 - Will Green: Nice
18/12/2016, 19:47 - Will Green: People don't know who chance is
18/12/2016, 19:47 - Will Green: Because they have bad taste
21/12/2016, 19:00 - Will Green: <Media omitted>

14/10/2017, 15:31 - Will Green: we'll be looking for someone to move in soon
14/10/2017, 15:31 - Will Green: will probably be the same price as I pay - £640 p/m
14/10/2017, 15:32 - Will Green: want to get in with a replacement before James does
15/10/2017, 16:18 - Greg: how soonish is soonish
15/10/2017, 16:18 - Greg: i have a plan but it might take a few months
15/10/2017, 16:21 - Will Green: December I’d say
15/10/2017, 16:21 - Will Green: Maybe early jan
15/10/2017, 16:21 - Will Green: Figured you’d probably saved loads now
15/10/2017, 16:21 - Will Green: And it’s cheap for London
15/10/2017, 16:22 - Greg: Yeah I mean I could live for a few months
15/10/2017, 16:22 - Greg: But I'd preferably have some kind of income
15/10/2017, 16:22 - Greg: Set up for when if I moved
15/10/2017, 16:29 - Will Green: Yeah for sure
15/10/2017, 16:30 - Will Green: Although I imagine you’d find something pretty easy
15/10/2017, 16:30 - Will Green: Could just sign up to another agency in London
15/10/2017, 16:30 - Will Green: Was it reed you got your current job through?
15/10/2017, 16:30 - Will Green: Think they operate in London
15/10/2017, 16:30 - Will Green: What’s your plan?
15/10/2017, 16:32 - Greg: Nah it wasn't reed
15/10/2017, 16:32 - Greg: It's pretty much I'm starting a new role tommorow
15/10/2017, 16:32 - Greg: And it's a "junior data analyst"
15/10/2017, 16:33 - Greg: i already know it doesn't really involve much actual data analysis stuff
15/10/2017, 16:33 - Greg: but im going to use it as cv fuel to go for that sort of job after I've been in it a couple of months
15/10/2017, 16:34 - Will Green: Nice one dude! That’s amazing
15/10/2017, 16:34 - Will Green: Congrats
15/10/2017, 16:34 - Will Green: Yeah you’ll be able to get another data analysis job off the back of it
15/10/2017, 16:34 - Will Green: Maybe another junior one if it’s tricky to find one
15/10/2017, 16:34 - Will Green: But that’s really decent
15/10/2017, 16:35 - Will Green: You’ve found your in
15/10/2017, 16:35 - Will Green: Our place is hiring data analysts all the time
15/10/2017, 16:35 - Will Green: Will keep an eye out
15/10/2017, 16:35 - Greg: yeah ill probably be after more of a training role since there isn't really much of that at my current work
15/10/2017, 16:36 - Greg: but it'll work out somehow
15/10/2017, 16:36 - Greg: but yeah I figure I need to be doing it for a month or two before I can go job hunting
15/10/2017, 16:46 - Will Green: Yeah that sounds like a good plan
15/10/2017, 16:47 - Will Green: Well if you do it until first week of jan
15/10/2017, 16:47 - Will Green: Then look for junior jobs on London
15/10/2017, 16:47 - Will Green: Get something lined up for a month later (you’ve probably got a notice period anyway)
15/10/2017, 16:56 - Will Green: My work has just sent an email around saying we’re moving office
15/10/2017, 16:56 - Will Green: In November

25/05/2018, 23:02 - Greg: + drink the entire way
25/05/2018, 23:02 - Greg: it makes you feel great once the toilet on the coach is overflowing and you have to hold it until you reach a middle of nowhere service somewhere in france
25/05/2018, 23:02 - Greg: did you know red wine makes you shit green
25/05/2018, 23:03 - Greg: i found that out that day

26/05/2018, 23:36 - Will Green: Need to get to King's Cross by 12
26/05/2018, 23:36 - Will Green: If we wanna see knuckle puck at 1
26/05/2018, 23:36 - Will Green: Just FYI
26/05/2018, 23:36 - Will Green: I'm meeting Adam from work there because he has my ticket
27/05/2018, 00:05 - Greg: How long does it take to get to King's Cross
27/05/2018, 00:06 - Greg: The earliest I can get to London is 11:14
27/05/2018, 00:06 - Will Green: Do that
27/05/2018, 00:07 - Will Green: Takes 20 mins from here to King's Cross
27/05/2018, 00:08 - Will Green: So I'd need to leave here at 11:33 to get to King cross before the train we need
27/05/2018, 00:08 - Will Green: So maybe I can meet you at the tube station or just meet you there?
27/05/2018, 00:08 - Will Green: Or do you wanna ditch stuff here first?
27/05/2018, 00:09 - Greg: Ditch stuff at yours first
27/05/2018, 00:09 - Greg: I don't wanna lug my backpack round
27/05/2018, 00:09 - Will Green: Yeah that's fair
27/05/2018, 00:09 - Will Green: Cool, well come to mine ditch your stuff and we'll go straight away
27/05/2018, 00:09 - Will Green: Might end up missing the first 15 mins of their set
27/05/2018, 00:09 - Will Green: But I'm sure they'll be late on stage anyway
27/05/2018, 00:10 - Will Green: And if we make the 12 train we'll be there a bit early
27/05/2018, 00:10 - Greg: I might be able to come earlier
27/05/2018, 00:10 - Will Green: But we're relying on Adam being at King's Cross on time too
27/05/2018, 00:10 - Will Green: Cause I need my ticket from him
27/05/2018, 00:11 - Will Green: Worst comes to worst you can go and I'll wait for him
27/05/2018, 00:16 - Greg: I can get in at 10:14
27/05/2018, 00:16 - Greg: I just have to wake up early
27/05/2018, 00:16 - Greg: Killer
27/05/2018, 00:16 - Greg: Who knew trains to London took so long from Portsmouth
27/05/2018, 00:16 - Greg: I didn't
27/05/2018, 06:15 - Will Green: Don't think 10:14 is necessary really

27/05/2018, 09:56 - Will Green: So Adam didn't have to wait
27/05/2018, 09:56 - Will Green: Doesn't *

12/07/2018, 12:33 - Will Green: also iwoca gave me a raise (long story, they gave it to me before I handed in my notice and it was really awkward and now they're obligated to pay me that until I leave)
12/07/2018, 12:34 - Will Green: yeah it's a months notice, but I have to work during that month - that's how notice periods work
12/07/2018, 12:34 - Greg: I know but you'd still have 2 weeks or so

12/07/2018, 12:34 - Greg: Oh I see
12/07/2018, 12:34 - Will Green: basically they've asked me if I can extend my notice period
12/07/2018, 12:34 - Greg: Succ the will while he's there
12/07/2018, 12:35 - Will Green: I'm not obliged to, but i'm going to because i'll accrue more untaken holiday and get a payout for it at the end
12/07/2018, 12:35 - Greg: Drain your brain into a creative robot
12/07/2018, 12:35 - Will Green: indeed

21/07/2018, 23:18 - Will Green: html and css
21/07/2018, 23:18 - Will Green: basically a native version of a web app for ios and android
21/07/2018, 23:18 - Will Green: or you could go full native and write it in kotlin
21/07/2018, 23:19 - Greg: hmmm
21/07/2018, 23:19 - Greg: i wonder if i even need an app
21/07/2018, 23:19 - Greg: probably

21/07/2018, 23:19 - Greg: cus ive made a thing that waters my plants for me
21/07/2018, 23:20 - Greg: and i want it to tell me when it decides to switch it on and off and for how long
21/07/2018, 23:20 - Greg: how hard can it be
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Will Green: you can do that without an appo
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Will Green: use something like onesignal
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Will Green: you can just embed it on a web page and it asks for chrome permissions
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Will Green: only works on android and desktop though
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Greg: lame
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Will Green: or you could just do it with an email probably
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Greg: im running it off a rasp
21/07/2018, 23:30 - Greg: raspo-pie
21/07/2018, 23:31 - Greg: maybe
21/07/2018, 23:31 - Greg: maybe i can just make a local web page
21/07/2018, 23:31 - Greg: but then ill want to keep data on it
21/07/2018, 23:31 - Greg: hmmm

21/07/2018, 23:34 - Greg: when you did android shit do you like continually just run it on a phone
21/07/2018, 23:35 - Greg: or like bluestacks or something
22/07/2018, 10:27 - Will Green: It's jsx and json
22/07/2018, 10:28 - Will Green: Jsx is html embedded in java script and the json is used to replace css. Syntax is fairly similar for both
22/07/2018, 10:28 - Will Green: Nah I ran an emulator using android studio

12/09/2018, 16:59 - Greg: Bruh
12/09/2018, 16:59 - Greg: You got any primo hints n tips for making a ui not shit
12/09/2018, 16:59 - Greg: Also isn't it your birthday soon
12/09/2018, 17:38 - Will Green: Haha bit late on that one
12/09/2018, 17:39 - Will Green: Birthday was in July
12/09/2018, 17:39 - Will Green: Errr
12/09/2018, 17:39 - Will Green: Write our a list of UI elements and order them by importance
12/09/2018, 17:39 - Will Green: Then make sure that the visual hierarchy of the page matches that order
12/09/2018, 17:40 - Will Green: Things that effect the visual hierarchy include position (top left to bottom right), size, colour contrast.
12/09/2018, 17:40 - Will Green: It's a combination of the above.
12/09/2018, 17:40 - Will Green: Think that's the best quick tip
12/09/2018, 17:41 - Greg: oh shit nigga i thought you were at the end of the summer holidays not the start
12/09/2018, 17:41 - Will Green: Focus more on layout than styling
12/09/2018, 17:41 - Greg: But you're younger than me
12/09/2018, 17:41 - Greg: So thwt wouldn't make any sense
12/09/2018, 17:41 - Will Green: Yes

12/09/2018, 17:41 - Will Green: I remember
12/09/2018, 17:42 - Will Green: And to be fair I didn't do a think
12/09/2018, 17:42 - Will Green: Like I said I would

12/09/2018, 18:33 - Greg: ui tip
12/09/2018, 18:34 - Greg: does that only apply to web pages
12/09/2018, 18:34 - Greg: because my thing isnt a web page
12/09/2018, 18:34 - Greg: its a thing
12/09/2018, 18:34 - Greg: i dont actually know what buttons ill need
12/09/2018, 18:34 - Greg: my plan was basically to make it up as i go along
12/09/2018, 18:35 - Greg: procedual generation of ui by human
12/09/2018, 19:00 - Will Green: what i said applies to any time of interface/graphic design
12/09/2018, 19:00 - Will Green: hierarchy is the most important thing for anything like that
12/09/2018, 19:00 - Will Green: basically just make sure that the most important things are the ones that grab whoever is looking at it
12/09/2018, 19:02 - Will Green: and if there's any elements that are associated, group them visually
12/09/2018, 19:03 - Will Green: just look at a newspaper or bbc news as a good example
12/09/2018, 19:03 - Will Green: the way they order and group content on the page
12/09/2018, 20:17 - Will Green: E?

07/10/2018, 12:01 - Greg: It's annoying me
07/10/2018, 12:01 - Greg: Is there anything I can do that isn't buying hardware
07/10/2018, 12:01 - Greg: Or do I just have to find some monitor calibration picture things and use my eyes
07/10/2018, 14:00 - Will Green: just do it by eye
07/10/2018, 14:00 - Will Green: that's the best bet
07/10/2018, 18:02 - Will Green: yo

10/10/2018, 20:38 - Will Green: Haha
10/10/2018, 20:38 - Will Green: I'm not sure tbh
10/10/2018, 20:38 - Will Green: I think there's performance tests out there
10/10/2018, 20:38 - Will Green: Like crystal disk mark may do ram?
10/10/2018, 20:39 - Greg: i think thats only if youve set up a ramdisk
10/10/2018, 20:40 - Greg: im figuring out what new shit i want anyway so ill probably just leave it in for now
10/10/2018, 21:10 - Will Green: Might be a good way to test though
10/10/2018, 21:11 - Will Green: E in a bit? Just heading back
10/10/2018, 21:13 - Greg: aeiou boiii

11/10/2018, 14:27 - Will Green: I want one of these so bad
11/10/2018, 14:27 - Will Green: https://www.ableton.com/en/push/
11/10/2018, 14:28 - Will Green: might sell my keyboard and the machine and get one
11/10/2018, 14:28 - Will Green: everything in ableton maps to it 1:1, so you never have to touch the software
11/10/2018, 14:28 - Will Green: you can do everything with the hardware
11/10/2018, 14:28 - Will Green: shut the lid of your laptop and just play stuff on it
11/10/2018, 14:29 - Greg: Do it
11/10/2018, 14:29 - Greg: Buy it you rich boi
11/10/2018, 14:30 - Will Green: but
11/10/2018, 14:30 - Will Green: it's £1,000
11/10/2018, 14:30 - Will Green: fuk
11/10/2018, 14:30 - Greg: Sublet your room for a month and sleep in the cupboard
11/10/2018, 14:30 - Will Green: tru
11/10/2018, 14:31 - Will Green: or I could just live on the streets forever
11/10/2018, 14:31 - Will Green: and have unlimited money
11/10/2018, 14:31 - Will Green: but no teeth
11/10/2018, 14:40 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
11/10/2018, 14:45 - Greg: HODL
11/10/2018, 14:45 - Greg: BUY
11/10/2018, 14:45 - Greg: FOMO
11/10/2018, 14:45 - Greg: i think ive got all my pc bits
11/10/2018, 14:46 - Greg: and i have the money to buy them now
11/10/2018, 14:46 - Greg: and i can
11/10/2018, 14:46 - Greg: being an adult is rad
11/10/2018, 14:47 - Will Green: Oh hell ye
11/10/2018, 14:47 - Will Green: Lemme know how it goes and I might buy all the same shit
11/10/2018, 14:47 - Will Green: You getting an nvme sad?
11/10/2018, 14:47 - Will Green: /ssd*
11/10/2018, 14:47 - Will Green: One of the pcie ones
11/10/2018, 14:47 - Greg: im thinking about it
11/10/2018, 14:48 - Greg: i sorta need to upgrade my storage in general
11/10/2018, 14:48 - Greg: ive got a 128 ssd and a 1TB hdd
11/10/2018, 14:48 - Greg: so an nvme would mean my SSD would be for just fast storage
11/10/2018, 14:48 - Greg: which may be kinda handy
11/10/2018, 14:48 - Greg: but i can get like a 500gb ssd for not that much money
11/10/2018, 14:52 - Greg: ram is so fucking expensive though
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: I see
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: I really wanna just ditch hdds
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: Get an nvme as a boot drive
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: Like 250gb
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: Then 500gb ssd maybe
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: Could always keep the hdd I have for porn and music
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Greg: im getting deep into ryzen ram shit
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: What ram are you going for?
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Greg: apparently i need a B-die ram kit
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Greg: i have no idea yet
11/10/2018, 15:01 - Will Green: Wut
11/10/2018, 15:02 - Greg: b-die is apparently some new kind of die that RAM uses
11/10/2018, 15:02 - Greg: and it plays well with ryzen cpus
11/10/2018, 15:02 - Greg: because they are more sensitive to changes in clock speed of ram
11/10/2018, 15:02 - Greg: which apparently a b-die makes almost non existant
11/10/2018, 15:03 - Greg: I'm just furiously browsing reddit until I find a good combo I can just steal
11/10/2018, 15:10 - Greg: <Media omitted>
11/10/2018, 15:12 - Will Green: Sounds awful
11/10/2018, 15:13 - Will Green: Please send me a link to the cpu mobo ram combo you go for
11/10/2018, 15:13 - Will Green: So I don't have to deal with this bullshit
11/10/2018, 15:14 - Greg: Of course massa does massa want anything else while I dance and jive for maasa
11/10/2018, 15:14 - Will Green: Yes
11/10/2018, 15:14 - Will Green: Free money
11/10/2018, 15:14 - Will Green: And for you to get a job in London
11/10/2018, 15:15 - Greg: Urgh fine
11/10/2018, 15:15 - Greg: I'll do my cv you slavedriver
11/10/2018, 15:15 - Greg: <Media omitted>
11/10/2018, 15:23 - Will Green: Excellent
11/10/2018, 15:41 - Greg: this is so fucking confusing
11/10/2018, 15:41 - Greg: apparently ryzens dont like odd timing memory
11/10/2018, 15:42 - Will Green: oh boy
11/10/2018, 15:42 - Will Green: good job you're getting new ram
11/10/2018, 15:43 - Will Green: or you'd be up the creek without a paddle
11/10/2018, 15:43 - Will Green: and what a nightmare that would be
11/10/2018, 15:44 - Greg: <Media omitted>
11/10/2018, 15:44 - Greg: its worse than i thought
11/10/2018, 15:44 - Greg: all my clock speeds are absolute garbage
11/10/2018, 15:44 - Greg: two of my sticks of ram dont even report the manufacturer
11/10/2018, 15:46 - Will Green: Take them out
11/10/2018, 15:46 - Will Green: Honestly you'll be better off
11/10/2018, 15:46 - Greg: all of them
11/10/2018, 15:46 - Greg: run on system memory
11/10/2018, 15:49 - Greg: god damn son
11/10/2018, 15:49 - Greg: the memory costs more than the cpu
11/10/2018, 15:49 - Greg: this is some bullshit
11/10/2018, 15:52 - Greg: okay
11/10/2018, 15:52 - Greg: i think this is a good price/performance for ryzen
11/10/2018, 15:52 - Greg: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/fcF3mq
11/10/2018, 16:04 - Greg: wait no
11/10/2018, 16:05 - Greg: alright
11/10/2018, 16:05 - Greg: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/Hh2zCb
11/10/2018, 16:05 - Greg: memory is 10 quid more
11/10/2018, 16:06 - Greg: but is probably the best without getting into 200_
11/10/2018, 16:06 - Greg: 200+
11/10/2018, 16:08 - Greg: also im not convinved an NVME ssd is worth the money over just getting a huge SSD instead
11/10/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: I thought the read/write speeds were waaaay better?
11/10/2018, 16:16 - Greg: like 4x better
11/10/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: £400 punds
11/10/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: wow
11/10/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: 4x i s pretty good...
11/10/2018, 16:16 - Greg: but ive been reading up and unless the rest of your system is just hanging around waiting for stuff to load it wont make any difference over an SSD
11/10/2018, 16:18 - Greg: basically the main argument is that in real life situations it ends up being 1/2 seconds faster loading something
11/10/2018, 16:18 - Greg: and the money you spend on a NVME could have bought you loads more space in an SSD
11/10/2018, 16:19 - Greg: if youve got the money then buy it son
11/10/2018, 16:19 - Will Green: not if I buy a push
11/10/2018, 16:19 - Will Green: how much is a 128 NVME?
11/10/2018, 16:19 - Will Green: I just want it as my boot drive
11/10/2018, 16:19 - Will Green: for that sweet 1 second boot time
11/10/2018, 16:19 - Greg: buy a push
11/10/2018, 16:19 - Greg: you wot
11/10/2018, 16:20 - Will Green: then i'll use an SSD for my games and a HDD for everything else
11/10/2018, 16:20 - Will Green: that ableton thing I linked you to
11/10/2018, 16:20 - Greg: looks like around 50
11/10/2018, 16:21 - Will Green: oh
11/10/2018, 16:21 - Will Green: wow
11/10/2018, 16:21 - Will Green: that's not as much as I thought it would be
11/10/2018, 16:21 - Will Green: interesting
11/10/2018, 16:22 - Will Green: does that MOBO support nvme?
11/10/2018, 16:22 - Greg: erm
11/10/2018, 16:22 - Greg: probably
11/10/2018, 16:34 - Greg: lol i just tried to log onto my bank to do money things
11/10/2018, 16:34 - Greg: and my fucking hsbc code thing has run out of battery
11/10/2018, 16:34 - Greg: fucking
11/10/2018, 16:34 - Greg: 1000/10 there hsbc
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Will Green: just fucking ditch them
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Will Green: they are utter wank
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Will Green: I switched to Metro and I hold most of my cash with them
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Will Green: they have a decent mobile app and you can just log in with touch id or whatever
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Greg: hmmmm
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Greg: neat
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Greg: ill have a look into it
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Will Green: and then I use Monzo for everything else (get paid in to it, manage money through it)
11/10/2018, 16:36 - Greg: also i think im going to buy some pricey ram
11/10/2018, 16:37 - Greg: the internet has told me its a good idea
11/10/2018, 16:37 - Will Green: the only thing I use metro for now is saving money because I don't trust monzo enough for them to have my cash
11/10/2018, 16:37 - Will Green: I think that sounds sensible
11/10/2018, 16:37 - Greg: me too
11/10/2018, 16:37 - Greg: my build is at 469 at the moment
11/10/2018, 16:37 - Greg: half is ram
11/10/2018, 16:37 - Will Green: also you can just do the current account switching service

12/10/2018, 19:32 - Will Green: Ya boi vim strikes again
12/10/2018, 19:32 - Will Green: I had to explain how to exit vim during a user testing session
12/10/2018, 19:33 - Will Green: It was fun
12/10/2018, 19:33 - Greg: "type colon q"
12/10/2018, 19:34 - Will Green: "Press exit, then colon, then type w and q and then press enter" * preses exit then can't find colon, pressed w, starts inserting text, adds q to the end of an ip address and adds an empty line *
12/10/2018, 19:34 - Greg: if you want you save you can just do :x
12/10/2018, 19:34 - Will Green: That doesn't save though does it?
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Greg: yeah
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Greg: save exit
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Will Green: Interesting
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Will Green: I was unaware of this
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Greg: your fucking exit time is already reduced by a third
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Greg: set up an autohotkey script to enter :x with a single key stroke
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Will Green: Boom
12/10/2018, 19:35 - Greg: youll be flying
12/10/2018, 19:36 - Will Green: Escape :x
12/10/2018, 19:36 - Will Green: The true escape
12/10/2018, 19:36 - Greg: why do you need to press escape
12/10/2018, 19:36 - Greg: its not like you navigate in insert mode
12/10/2018, 19:36 - Greg: is it will?
12/10/2018, 19:36 - Greg: is it?
12/10/2018, 19:36 - Will Green: Why would I be using vim if I wasn't editing a file?
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Will Green: I'd just cat it
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Greg: nigga watt
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Greg: insert mode is inserting text
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Greg: rather than it reading input as vim commands
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Greg: as in
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Greg: when you press i
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Greg: and start typing
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Will Green: Yeah, I mean the only time I'm likely to exit
12/10/2018, 19:37 - Will Green: Is when I'm typing
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Will Green: Because otherwise I wouldn't be in vim editing a file
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Will Green: A normal use case is
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Will Green: Open vim
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Will Green: Insert
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Will Green: Exit
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Greg: lol who uses vim for that
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Greg: use nano you fukkin tryhard
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Will Green: < use nano
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Greg: literally nothing wrong with nano
12/10/2018, 19:38 - Greg: if i want to edit a single line
12/10/2018, 19:39 - Greg: ezpz
12/10/2018, 19:39 - Greg: anyone who says otherwise is probably running freebSD
12/10/2018, 19:40 - Will Green: Sure
12/10/2018, 19:41 - Will Green: But
12/10/2018, 19:41 - Will Green: It's still nano

13/10/2018, 16:41 - Greg: its just so fucking stupid in every way
13/10/2018, 16:41 - Greg: what if it gets caught in customs
13/10/2018, 16:42 - Will Green: I bet it just creates heat too
13/10/2018, 16:42 - Greg: nah
13/10/2018, 16:42 - Greg: the bullets absorb the heat
13/10/2018, 16:42 - Greg: then they get fired away
13/10/2018, 16:42 - Will Green: ah yeah
13/10/2018, 16:42 - Will Green: of course

13/10/2018, 16:44 - Greg: still cant put any of it in though cus you cant plug an AM2 cpu into AM4
13/10/2018, 16:44 - Greg: so theyre both useless
13/10/2018, 16:45 - Will Green: oh, that actually looks okay
13/10/2018, 16:45 - Will Green: apart from the bit where it says tomahawk
13/10/2018, 16:45 - Will Green: like a missile
13/10/2018, 16:45 - Will Green: ohhhh
13/10/2018, 16:45 - Will Green: so you haven't got the cpu yet?
13/10/2018, 16:45 - Greg: it's because that motherboard kills brown people

13/10/2018, 16:51 - Greg: But
13/10/2018, 16:51 - Greg: Might have been fine
13/10/2018, 16:52 - Greg: I haven't really talked to her all that much so I don't really know what she's like

16/10/2018, 15:58 - Greg: 他妈的你他妈的说什么关于我，你小婊子？我会让你知道我毕业于海军陆战队的顶级班，我曾经参与过许多对基地组织的秘密袭击，而且我已经杀死了300多人。我在大猩猩战争中训练，我是整个美军的最高狙击手。你对我没有什么，只是另一个目标。我会用精确的方法把你的东西擦掉，这些东西在这个地球上从来没有见过，标记着他妈的话。你认为你可以逃避说在互联网上对我说狗屎？再想想，笨蛋。正如我们所说，我正在联系我在美国的间谍秘密网络，你的知识产权正在被追踪，所以你最好准备应对风暴，蛆。这场风暴把你所谓的可怜小东西抹去了。你他妈的死了，孩子。我可以在任何地方，任何时候，我可以用超过七百种方法杀死你，这只是我的赤手空拳。我不仅在手无寸铁的战斗中接受过广泛的训练，而且还可以进入美国海军陆战队的整个军火库，我将充分利用它来清除非洲大陆面前的悲惨屁股。如果只有你能够知道什么邪恶的报复，你的小“聪明”的评论即将降临在你身上，也许你会拿着你他妈的舌头。但是你不能，你没有，现在你付出代价，你这个白痴。我会把你的怒气全都压在你身上，你会被淹死的。你他妈的死了，孩子。

17/10/2018, 13:37 - Will Green: Ikr
17/10/2018, 13:37 - Will Green: Apparently coinbase is going to start listing a bunch of new stuff

17/10/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: I bet the fan is alright
17/10/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: but the thermal paste will be utter wank
17/10/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: probably worse than toothpaste
17/10/2018, 16:25 - Greg: Yeah I might re do it
17/10/2018, 16:25 - Greg: I don't want it fucking up before the mount arrives

12/11/2018, 17:13 - Will Green: It's meant to be really quick
12/11/2018, 17:18 - Greg: yeah
12/11/2018, 17:18 - Greg: the only thing that stopped me is that you need to do it on your router really rather than just local machine
12/11/2018, 17:18 - Greg: and i dont want to fuck up my house internet
12/11/2018, 17:20 - Will Green: You can do it on your phone pretty easily

13/11/2018, 11:53 - Greg: Yeah new album
13/11/2018, 11:53 - Greg: I was going to say earlier there's some restaurant on fleet with a sandwich board outside advertising stuff and theyve used comedy chevrons as bulletpoints
13/11/2018, 11:53 - Greg: And when I saw it I just started reading it like a greentext
13/11/2018, 11:53 - Greg: Fuck sake

14/11/2018, 12:02 - Greg: I need to use your brain anyway
14/11/2018, 12:02 - Greg: I don't know how to do good css
14/11/2018, 12:02 - Will Green: Oh really?
14/11/2018, 12:03 - Will Green: Fire away
14/11/2018, 13:14 - Greg: It's mostly just arranging things
14/11/2018, 13:14 - Greg: But I'll see what I need from you later
14/11/2018, 13:26 - Will Green: dope
14/11/2018, 15:54 - Greg: Is the root html page just traditionally called index
14/11/2018, 15:55 - Will Green: yeah, that's what the browser is built to look at first
14/11/2018, 15:55 - Will Green: when it's directed to a directory
14/11/2018, 15:55 - Will Green: so sub pages should be in subfolders
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Will Green: with indexes
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Greg: What form does the index take
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Will Green: i.e. greg.com/test would be test/index.html
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Will Green: form?
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Greg: Ah
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Greg: I was thinking like
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Greg: Numbers as an index
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Will Green: no
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Greg: Wait what
14/11/2018, 15:56 - Greg: So you just call everything index?
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Will Green: you just call the root html file index.html
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Greg: But sub pages
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Will Green: if it's static
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Greg: You just put a file called index in a subfokder
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Will Green: yeah, that's the easiest way of doing it
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Greg: Folder
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Will Green: or you can do other fancy stuff
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Will Green: just make a subdirectory
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Will Green: and put index.html in that
14/11/2018, 15:58 - Greg: I see
14/11/2018, 15:59 - Greg: Doesn't that get confusing when you're editing multiple of them
14/11/2018, 15:59 - Will Green: when you use a framework or something, ultimately it's being compiled down to that structure
14/11/2018, 15:59 - Greg: Or do you not really do that
14/11/2018, 15:59 - Will Green: or for react or whatever
14/11/2018, 15:59 - Will Green: it's just some giant bundle

22/11/2018, 23:35 - Will Green: She got an interdenominational discrepancy
22/11/2018, 23:35 - Greg: Ooh naughty
22/11/2018, 23:36 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
22/11/2018, 23:37 - Greg: That's insane
22/11/2018, 23:38 - Will Green: She replied saying she had a really busy day at work, blah blah
22/11/2018, 23:38 - Will Green: Think I'm going to sack her off
22/11/2018, 23:38 - Greg: Probably a good idea
22/11/2018, 23:39 - Greg: Will the spooky spectre
22/11/2018, 23:42 - Will Green: Spooky?
22/11/2018, 23:42 - Greg: Like some kind of luminous spirit her
22/11/2018, 23:45 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
22/11/2018, 23:45 - Greg: Imagine if you'd spent your time making that game
22/11/2018, 23:45 - Greg: And it ended up being that game
22/11/2018, 23:46 - Will Green: Hahaha
23/11/2018, 12:33 - Will Green: dude you've gotta get an amex

23/11/2018, 12:33 - Will Green: it's madness
23/11/2018, 12:34 - Will Green: also, just discovered that registering to vote boosts your credit score (???)

23/11/2018, 12:38 - Will Green: just put literally everything through it
23/11/2018, 12:38 - Will Green: if you spend £2k on it in the first 3 months (which you probably will if you stick everything on it) you get 20k points
23/11/2018, 12:38 - Will Green: which is like £200
23/11/2018, 12:39 - Will Green: oh, also, I was going to tell you last night but totally forgot
23/11/2018, 12:39 - Will Green: you should call virgin media
23/11/2018, 12:40 - Will Green: because they called me saying I was eligibile for an upgrade (???) and I was like "well i'm not using all of my data right now, I think I actually may be paying too much" and then they were like, "well actually you're on 30gb for £20pcm now but we can upgrade you to 40gb for £13pcm"
23/11/2018, 12:40 - Will Green: so I just cut £7 off my monthly phone bill
23/11/2018, 12:40 - Will Green: and got 10gb more data
23/11/2018, 12:41 - Greg: lol wut
23/11/2018, 12:41 - Will Green: ikr
23/11/2018, 12:41 - Will Green: madness
23/11/2018, 12:41 - Greg: oh i got a text from virgin saying that
23/11/2018, 12:41 - Greg: i think they tried to call me but i never answered
23/11/2018, 12:41 - Greg: because i just assumed they were gunna try and make me send more money
23/11/2018, 12:43 - Will Green: well ring them on 789
23/11/2018, 12:43 - Will Green: from your mobile
23/11/2018, 12:43 - Will Green: and tell them that your friend recently got a call about an upgrade and switched plan to the above
23/11/2018, 12:43 - Will Green: and say that they text you saying you're eligible
23/11/2018, 12:44 - Will Green: yeah, they started by trying to give me some phone on a 24 month contract
23/11/2018, 12:44 - Will Green: and trying to increase my rate
23/11/2018, 12:44 - Will Green: and I was like 'I just bought an iPhone Xs and I only use half the data i'm paying for with you, so i'd like to reduce my monthly fee'
23/11/2018, 12:44 - Will Green: could literally hear her thinking "ffs my boss is going to hate me"
23/11/2018, 13:09 - Greg: poor person
23/11/2018, 13:09 - Greg: thats so cheap
23/11/2018, 13:09 - Greg: £13 a month for 40gb
23/11/2018, 13:09 - Greg: i dont even know how much i use
23/11/2018, 13:09 - Greg: i dont think i get to 20
23/11/2018, 13:16 - Will Green: Yeah exactly
23/11/2018, 13:16 - Will Green: I was the same
23/11/2018, 13:16 - Will Green: I asked if I could pay less and get less and she said you can get 10gb for £10 or 40gb for £13
23/11/2018, 13:16 - Greg: what a choice
23/11/2018, 13:16 - Will Green: So I asked her for my average data usage per month and she said 11gb
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Will Green: With a peak of 35gb
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Will Green: So I was like "40gb pls"
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Greg: i mean
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Greg: even if you didnt
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Greg: its £3 for 30gb
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Will Green: Yeah exactly
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Will Green: It's madness
23/11/2018, 13:17 - Will Green: I honestly don't understand it
23/11/2018, 13:18 - Greg: i mean the extra cost to them is probably almost nothing
23/11/2018, 13:18 - Greg: and they get to keep you as a happy ol customer
23/11/2018, 13:18 - Greg: so i guess its worth it for them
23/11/2018, 13:18 - Will Green: Ye
23/11/2018, 13:18 - Will Green: But they just reduced my annual bill by like £100
23/11/2018, 13:18 - Will Green: Plebs
23/11/2018, 13:19 - Greg: fucking degenerates
23/11/2018, 13:19 - Greg: also i found something out the other day
23/11/2018, 13:19 - Greg: one of the white dudes in death grips drums for a math rock band

23/11/2018, 13:53 - Greg: i dont even know what id do with one
23/11/2018, 13:53 - Will Green: you could set it up to control the volume of your pc

23/11/2018, 14:01 - Will Green: I actually don't know what's happened to it recently
23/11/2018, 14:01 - Will Green: because it was absolutely fine before
23/11/2018, 14:01 - Will Green: maybe it's just because it's in a bigger room
23/11/2018, 14:01 - Will Green: or maybe my voice has changed a bit and I need to retrain it
24/11/2018, 17:55 - Greg: wtf visual studio code is great
24/11/2018, 17:55 - Greg: its like atom if it wasnt wank

26/11/2018, 17:33 - Greg: It wants me to enter my mobile number and put in a code it sends me
26/11/2018, 17:34 - Greg: But every time I do it it auto reads the code from the text and just says "something went wrong contact someone of this continues"
26/11/2018, 17:34 - Greg: Super helpful error
26/11/2018, 19:27 - Will Green: I see

27/11/2018, 16:51 - Will Green: games*
27/11/2018, 16:51 - Will Green: when your hand rests on WASD

28/11/2018, 22:06 - Greg: <Media omitted>
28/11/2018, 22:06 - Greg: :(
28/11/2018, 22:07 - Will Green: it says you're on discord
28/11/2018, 22:07 - Will Green: i am confoosd
28/11/2018, 22:08 - Greg: Left pc to restart
28/11/2018, 22:08 - Greg: Am pooping
28/11/2018, 22:08 - Greg: I think it's a no wiper
28/11/2018, 22:08 - Greg: I won't be long
29/11/2018, 15:18 - Will Green: i've got an idea for something
29/11/2018, 15:18 - Will Green: that you can make
29/11/2018, 15:18 - Will Green: and use it to learn javascript
29/11/2018, 15:18 - Will Green: pottentially
29/11/2018, 15:20 - Greg: Go on my son
29/11/2018, 15:22 - Will Green: soooo
29/11/2018, 15:22 - Will Green: basically when I use a browser I tend to have tabs categorised in to different things
29/11/2018, 15:22 - Will Green: i.e. I have one load of tabs for work related shit
29/11/2018, 15:22 - Will Green: and then a bunch of tabs for other stuff
29/11/2018, 15:23 - Will Green: so it would be great to have some way to group them in the nav at the top
29/11/2018, 15:23 - Will Green: and to expand/collapse the groups
29/11/2018, 15:23 - Will Green: OneTab does this pretty well, but it basically closes and re-opens them
29/11/2018, 15:23 - Will Green: which is annoying
29/11/2018, 15:25 - Greg: Interesting
29/11/2018, 15:25 - Greg: I'll give it a go
29/11/2018, 15:26 - Will Green: 👌
29/11/2018, 15:42 - Will Green: I think you can do it as a chrome extension
29/11/2018, 15:58 - Greg: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

03/12/2018, 15:08 - Will Green: wealthsimple is like a managed account
03/12/2018, 15:09 - Will Green: you put money in and they automatically invest it
03/12/2018, 15:09 - Will Green: well, it's managed by a human
03/12/2018, 15:09 - Will Green: so not automatic, but they do it for you
03/12/2018, 15:09 - Will Green: if you get what I mean

03/12/2018, 18:37 - Greg: bruh
03/12/2018, 18:37 - Greg: i dont think what you want is possible without some awful hacky solution
03/12/2018, 18:37 - Greg: chrome has some beastly resource management
03/12/2018, 18:39 - Greg: even if theyre shared out between supertabs like you want itll still just background whatever ones you arent using
03/12/2018, 18:40 - Greg: i mean i think you can turn that off
03/12/2018, 18:40 - Greg: but it might fuck ur pc up
03/12/2018, 18:40 - Greg: 2000% ram usage
03/12/2018, 19:11 - Will Green: Hmmm
03/12/2018, 19:11 - Will Green: I think it should work in theory
03/12/2018, 19:12 - Will Green: I think you'd have to do some hack shit
03/12/2018, 19:12 - Will Green: Use a page file or something
03/12/2018, 19:12 - Will Green: Or write some better way to cache
03/12/2018, 19:13 - Greg: the only thing ive thought of is just like save the actual pages on your pc
03/12/2018, 19:13 - Greg: then it just loads them locally when you open it
03/12/2018, 19:14 - Will Green: E?

03/12/2018, 19:18 - Greg: some will be fucky though probably
03/12/2018, 19:18 - Greg: maybe ill just make a whitelist of ones that always reload themselves
03/12/2018, 19:18 - Greg: like you dont want a local version of whatsapp loading
03/12/2018, 19:18 - Greg: itll just shit itself
03/12/2018, 19:46 - Will Green: what does the UI look like?

03/12/2018, 20:54 - Greg: There's a single button
03/12/2018, 20:54 - Greg: That saves a page in a sort of OK way
03/12/2018, 20:56 - Will Green: I see i see

04/12/2018, 15:12 - Greg: 6"3?
04/12/2018, 15:12 - Will Green: nope
04/12/2018, 15:13 - Will Green: 6' dead on
04/12/2018, 15:13 - Greg: Ooooo
04/12/2018, 15:13 - Will Green: without shoes
04/12/2018, 15:13 - Greg: Duh
04/12/2018, 15:13 - Will Green: obviously
04/12/2018, 15:14 - Greg: <Media omitted>
04/12/2018, 15:57 - Will Green: lmfao
04/12/2018, 21:16 - Will Green: e?
04/12/2018, 21:31 - Greg: yes
05/12/2018, 11:07 - Will Green: you working today?
05/12/2018, 12:17 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
05/12/2018, 13:04 - Greg: I am
05/12/2018, 13:04 - Greg: Hahahaha
05/12/2018, 13:04 - Greg: Oh no
05/12/2018, 13:06 - Will Green: Amazing isn't it
05/12/2018, 13:06 - Will Green: Dw I sent him in the right direction
05/12/2018, 13:07 - Greg: "use nodejs you Faggot"
05/12/2018, 13:10 - Will Green: VSC my dude
05/12/2018, 13:10 - Will Green: And learn CSS
05/12/2018, 13:10 - Will Green: That's the answer
05/12/2018, 13:25 - Greg: Vcs?
05/12/2018, 13:26 - Greg: Visual
05/12/2018, 13:26 - Greg: Studio code?
05/12/2018, 13:26 - Greg: Also what the heck is jquery
05/12/2018, 13:26 - Greg: Whenever I seadch for a thing for java script someone gives an answer in jquery
05/12/2018, 13:26 - Greg: And someone always reply with a solution in vanilla js that's no longer
05/12/2018, 13:36 - Will Green: it was big ages ago
05/12/2018, 13:36 - Will Green: it's just a library for javascript basically
05/12/2018, 13:36 - Will Green: an extension to vanilla js
05/12/2018, 13:36 - Will Green: with some built in stuff
05/12/2018, 13:37 - Will Green: people tend to avoid it these days
05/12/2018, 13:37 - Will Green: ES6 is decent enough
05/12/2018, 13:37 - Will Green: and using vanilla js is generally more performant
05/12/2018, 14:04 - Greg: Well I thought it was like a module to do extra stuff
05/12/2018, 14:05 - Greg: But there always seems to be a way to do it in vanilla
05/12/2018, 14:05 - Greg: So I just stuck to that
05/12/2018, 14:05 - Greg: Who knows
05/12/2018, 14:06 - Greg: Oh I was going to ask a thing I think comes user ux
05/12/2018, 14:06 - Greg: So for the tab thing
05/12/2018, 14:06 - Greg: If you have a bunch of tabs open already
05/12/2018, 14:07 - Greg: What's a simple way to organise them into the groups you want
05/12/2018, 14:08 - Greg: The only thing I can think of is just a giant list with checkboxes
05/12/2018, 14:08 - Greg: But that'll look shit
05/12/2018, 14:08 - Greg: Or a thing to add the current tab to a group
05/12/2018, 14:08 - Greg: But if you want to do loads it'll take ages
05/12/2018, 14:09 - Will Green: there isn't really anything you can't do in vanilla js that you an in jquery I think?
05/12/2018, 14:09 - Will Green: that might be wrong
05/12/2018, 14:10 - Will Green: but as far as I know it just introduces another layer to simplify some fundamental stuff
05/12/2018, 14:10 - Will Green: errr
05/12/2018, 14:10 - Will Green: let me have a think
05/12/2018, 14:11 - Will Green: in chrome you can shift click tabs to select multiple tabs
05/12/2018, 14:11 - Will Green: so maybe do that and have a keyboard shortcut like command (or control on windows) + g
05/12/2018, 14:11 - Will Green: (which is a familiar shortcut in other tools)
05/12/2018, 14:11 - Will Green: and then also have a button in the Chrome GUI for plebs that don't want to use keyboard shortcuts
05/12/2018, 14:11 - Will Green: could just be a little extension button to the right of the URL bar
05/12/2018, 14:12 - Will Green: that quite obviously looks like a button that will group something
05/12/2018, 14:12 - Will Green: needs an inactive state though, to show that you can't click it unless you have multiple tabs selected
05/12/2018, 14:12 - Will Green: and then when you have 1> tabs selected, it activates
05/12/2018, 14:12 - Will Green: could do it with an opacity/colour change
05/12/2018, 14:13 - Will Green: also, it would be wicked if you could then immediately name the groups
05/12/2018, 14:13 - Will Green: i.e. the moment you press command+g, the new group of tabs auto focusses to an input field where you can give the group a name
05/12/2018, 14:13 - Will Green: type the name, hit enter
05/12/2018, 14:14 - Will Green: then you could do some really cool shit after that, like intelligently trying to name the tab based on the content of the group
05/12/2018, 14:14 - Will Green: a bit like how iOS automatically names folders
05/12/2018, 14:14 - Will Green: i.e. if you create a group of tabs like including facebook, twitter, etc. auto name it 'Social'
05/12/2018, 14:22 - Greg: Hmmm auto naming might be doable
05/12/2018, 14:23 - Greg: Maybe I'll make a default set of auto naming and let people just make a config to let people put in what sites make tabs auto name to
05/12/2018, 14:24 - Greg: Ahhh coming up for ideas for functionally is so easy
05/12/2018, 14:58 - Will Green: yep
05/12/2018, 14:58 - Will Green: all about execution
05/12/2018, 18:58 - Will Green: E?
05/12/2018, 19:12 - Greg: ye

07/12/2018, 17:15 - Will Green: That must be pretty old now
07/12/2018, 17:15 - Greg: No idea
07/12/2018, 17:16 - Greg: snapchat gave me a notification about memories

08/12/2018, 15:43 - Greg: im pretty sure this is impossible in javascript without becoming mad complicated
08/12/2018, 15:43 - Greg: rip dream
08/12/2018, 15:52 - Will Green: Hmm
08/12/2018, 15:52 - Will Green: Stack overflow is your friend
08/12/2018, 15:52 - Greg: wow thanks
08/12/2018, 15:53 - Greg: i havent tried that
08/12/2018, 15:53 - Greg: its more that theres only like 2 ways to save a completed web page
08/12/2018, 15:54 - Greg: and doing that just throws up a load of download notifications in chrome
08/12/2018, 15:54 - Greg: which looks lame
08/12/2018, 16:03 - Greg: Does Pete do js stuff
08/12/2018, 16:03 - Greg: Or just php
08/12/2018, 16:10 - Will Green: oh
08/12/2018, 16:10 - Will Green: you only should be saving the URL I think
08/12/2018, 16:10 - Will Green: or a mixture of the two
08/12/2018, 16:10 - Will Green: i.e. save locally for 30 seconds incase they re-open
08/12/2018, 16:10 - Will Green: and then timeout the local version after that time
08/12/2018, 16:10 - Will Green: fall back to just the URL as a string
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Greg: saving a local version is hard as heck
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: well you shouldn't be saving the .html
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: that's pointless
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Greg: eh
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: you effectively need to keep the tab open but hide the tab visually maybe
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Greg: cant hide tabs
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: saving the page through the browser won't work
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Greg: i know
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Will Green: because you'll just be saving the .html
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Greg: ive got that far
08/12/2018, 16:11 - Greg: no
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Will Green: it'll have no styling
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Greg: ive been saving it as an mthml
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Greg: which saves everything
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Will Green: but it still isn't hooked up to their servers right?
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Will Green: like
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Will Green: the js won't work
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Will Green: for forms and things
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Greg: no
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Will Green: and authentication for things like facebook won't work?
08/12/2018, 16:12 - Greg: nope
08/12/2018, 16:13 - Will Green: yeah
08/12/2018, 16:13 - Will Green: then that's pretty pointless
08/12/2018, 16:14 - Greg: i think theres a reason someone hasnt made it already
08/12/2018, 16:14 - Greg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/hide
08/12/2018, 16:14 - Greg: why cant chrome just have that
08/12/2018, 16:14 - Greg: it would make it so simple
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Will Green: I think the best thing to do from a UX POV is to just save the page URL
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Will Green: because ultimately even if you could just hide them visually in the browser GUI, they'd still be eating up resources in the background
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Will Green: which in chrome is already a nigihtmare
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Will Green: it would encourage people to have even more tabs open
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Will Green: and use even more RAM
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Greg: yeah
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Greg: ok
08/12/2018, 16:15 - Greg: maybe time for a respec
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Greg: instead of being about to use them offline
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Greg: they just load themselves again
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Greg: woo easy
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: yep
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: you can even do some cacheing stuff within that I think
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: to improve loading times
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: but leave that as an after though
08/12/2018, 16:16 - Will Green: thought*
08/12/2018, 16:17 - Greg: ezpz
08/12/2018, 16:42 - Greg: what were you thinking for switching groups
08/12/2018, 16:42 - Greg: like ctrl+1,2 etc
08/12/2018, 16:42 - Greg: or a clicky menu
08/12/2018, 16:45 - Will Green: GUI
08/12/2018, 16:46 - Greg: your apm will suffer but ok
08/12/2018, 16:49 - Will Green: Add shortcuts too
08/12/2018, 16:49 - Will Green: But you'll need to research existing shortcuts
08/12/2018, 16:49 - Will Green: For chrome and popular tab managers
08/12/2018, 16:50 - Will Green: Other extensions etc
08/12/2018, 16:50 - Will Green: To make sure it doesn't clash
08/12/2018, 17:34 - Will Green: fancy a game?
08/12/2018, 17:34 - Greg: im goin out in 10
08/12/2018, 17:34 - Greg: 🗿

08/12/2018, 20:52 - Greg: Is 25 quid really that much to not have hearing damage every time you go out
08/12/2018, 20:54 - Greg: They're super low profile too so no one ever notices them

10/12/2018, 11:00 - Will Green: it's so fucking weird
10/12/2018, 11:00 - Will Green: freaks me out
10/12/2018, 11:10 - Greg: What's a powerball
10/12/2018, 11:10 - Greg: Like the lottery?
10/12/2018, 11:11 - Will Green: google it
10/12/2018, 11:11 - Will Green: you'll have a good chuckle
10/12/2018, 11:13 - Greg: What the fuck is that
10/12/2018, 11:13 - Will Green: it's to improve your grip strength
10/12/2018, 11:13 - Will Green: people use it for climbing
10/12/2018, 11:14 - Greg: It's a bit small to climb isn't it?
10/12/2018, 11:14 - Greg: I could do that
10/12/2018, 11:14 - Will Green: It's deceptively small
10/12/2018, 11:14 - Will Green: It's just really far away
10/12/2018, 11:15 - Greg: Ahhhh
10/12/2018, 11:16 - Greg: How does it work
10/12/2018, 11:17 - Will Green: You basically pull a cord to get it spinning and it has a weighted gyroscope in it
10/12/2018, 11:17 - Will Green: That rotates at a really high rpm
10/12/2018, 11:17 - Will Green: And you hold it in your hand and rotate your wrist slowly
10/12/2018, 11:17 - Will Green: Stabilising it as you rotate basically
10/12/2018, 11:19 - Greg: So you're sitting there trying to start a lawn mower and waving a ball around
10/12/2018, 11:19 - Greg: Are you wearing your harness too
10/12/2018, 11:20 - Will Green: I'm not doing it at work... Hahaha
10/12/2018, 11:20 - Will Green: It's not a gym
10/12/2018, 11:20 - Will Green: And I don't wear that thing at work either because it looks horrific
10/12/2018, 11:24 - Greg: Where do you find all this shit
10/12/2018, 11:24 - Will Green: Someone I climb with recommended powerballs for grip strength
10/12/2018, 11:24 - Will Green: And my PT recommended it too
10/12/2018, 11:45 - Greg: Oh warp zone?
10/12/2018, 11:46 - Will Green: his name evolves over time doesn't it
10/12/2018, 11:51 - Greg: It's just at the right level of forgettable and malleable
10/12/2018, 11:54 - Will Green: good old warp zone
10/12/2018, 11:54 - Will Green: going to warp my fat to the zone

10/12/2018, 23:23 - Will Green: Dennis to the waitress on their date "have you got any makeup on"
10/12/2018, 23:23 - Will Green: Waitress "Yeah?"

11/12/2018, 10:21 - Will Green: Hmm
11/12/2018, 10:21 - Will Green: Interesting
11/12/2018, 10:21 - Will Green: Shall listen
11/12/2018, 22:35 - Will Green: e?
11/12/2018, 22:41 - Will Green: https://youtu.be/Ux8AC1mNVCo
12/12/2018, 14:52 - Will Green: do you use headspace?
12/12/2018, 14:52 - Will Green: I think you said you did?
12/12/2018, 15:17 - Greg: I did
12/12/2018, 15:17 - Greg: I do
12/12/2018, 15:17 - Will Green: is it actually any good?
12/12/2018, 15:17 - Will Green: is it worth giving a go?
12/12/2018, 15:18 - Greg: Oh no the one I have is called aware
12/12/2018, 15:19 - Greg: The dev was giving away jets in reddit
12/12/2018, 15:20 - Greg: Keyat
12/12/2018, 15:20 - Will Green: jets?
12/12/2018, 15:21 - Greg: Keys
12/12/2018, 15:21 - Greg: On
12/12/2018, 15:26 - Will Green: I see
12/12/2018, 15:26 - Will Green: Is it good?
12/12/2018, 15:27 - Will Green: Why that over headspace? I thought headspace was the best one?
12/12/2018, 15:27 - Greg: It's alright?
12/12/2018, 15:27 - Greg: I'm still not sure if it's actually useful or if it's just telling me to breath in weird ways
12/12/2018, 15:27 - Greg: Some of them seem like prime bullshit
12/12/2018, 15:32 - Will Green: yeah, I think that's the general gist of it
12/12/2018, 15:32 - Will Green: it's all about breathing, right?
12/12/2018, 15:33 - Will Green: I wonder if there's a simpler way to do it
12/12/2018, 15:33 - Will Green: like... just have something that times your breathing
12/12/2018, 15:33 - Will Green: rather than reading shit to you
12/12/2018, 15:33 - Will Green: and charging you a monthly fee
12/12/2018, 15:35 - Greg: It's got some stuff you're supposed to think about like concentrating on parts of your body or whatever
12/12/2018, 15:35 - Greg: I'm sure there's a free one out there that's just as good
12/12/2018, 15:40 - Will Green: this is the bit which i don't get
12/12/2018, 15:42 - Greg: i think its supposed to just be things to stop you thinking about whatevers bothering you
12/12/2018, 15:43 - Greg: so by concentrating on something weird like that i guess it does its job
12/12/2018, 16:07 - Will Green: I see
12/12/2018, 16:07 - Will Green: hmm
12/12/2018, 16:07 - Will Green: maybe there's actual science to it
12/12/2018, 19:10 - Greg: i guess theres gotta be something to it maybe
15/12/2018, 13:05 - Greg: Why'd you have to go on holiday

10/01/2019, 17:22 - Greg: that a huge X
10/01/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: but that really is the absolute limit in my mind

10/01/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: I mean
10/01/2019, 17:22 - Greg: itll take up your entire room
10/01/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: £26k would literally be a flat deposit
10/01/2019, 17:23 - Greg: youll have to hire a crane to get that X out your flat when you move
10/01/2019, 17:26 - Will Green: 🏗
10/01/2019, 17:26 - Will Green: ❌
10/01/2019, 17:26 - Greg: you got it
10/01/2019, 17:27 - Greg: i think you should ride it out
10/01/2019, 17:27 - Will Green: I think you're probably right
10/01/2019, 17:28 - Will Green: it's so tempting though
10/01/2019, 17:28 - Will Green: imagine receiving that amount of money in to your bank account
10/01/2019, 17:28 - Will Green: I think i'd actually shit
10/01/2019, 17:28 - Greg: what right there
10/01/2019, 17:28 - Greg: middle of a meeting

10/01/2019, 17:31 - Greg: exactly
10/01/2019, 17:31 - Will Green: thing is I'll get taxed loads of it increases a lot more
10/01/2019, 17:31 - Will Green: capital gains is like 11k free
10/01/2019, 17:31 - Greg: yeah but itll still go up
10/01/2019, 17:31 - Greg: its not like they start taxing the first 11k once you hit a bracket
10/01/2019, 17:31 - Will Green: obviously
10/01/2019, 17:32 - Will Green: but the gains beyond that become less profitable
10/01/2019, 17:32 - Greg: hmm true
10/01/2019, 17:32 - Greg: you should probably sell it all then tbh
10/01/2019, 17:32 - Greg: you fukkin gnomebag
10/01/2019, 17:33 - Will Green: I think it's taxed quite low actually
10/01/2019, 17:33 - Will Green: seems like it's about 15%
10/01/2019, 17:33 - Greg: ride the wave
10/01/2019, 17:33 - Greg: 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊

10/01/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: hahahaha
10/01/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: I knew you were going to say that
10/01/2019, 17:35 - Greg: you should probably keep making loads of money

10/01/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: i'd love one of these
10/01/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: <Media omitted>

10/01/2019, 17:44 - Will Green: yep
10/01/2019, 17:44 - Will Green: well, sort of
10/01/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: I think it has something to do with the fact that you don't have to pedal at all to engage the motor
10/01/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: so it's technically considered a motorbike or some shit
10/01/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: but in the states it's considered a bicycle
10/01/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: so anyone can ride one
10/01/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: they go like 30mph or something
10/01/2019, 17:45 - Greg: freedome
10/01/2019, 17:45 - Greg: 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
10/01/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: but the acceleration is meant to be insane
10/01/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: and also, it looks fucking sick
10/01/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: that one is a bit gross
10/01/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: there's other ones that just look like choppers
10/01/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
10/01/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: you can get the big chopper style lights on the front of them too
10/01/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: and don't forget the clown horns

10/01/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: touche
10/01/2019, 17:49 - Greg: you should blast some lil pump when you ride round

10/01/2019, 17:51 - Greg: you should get one
10/01/2019, 17:51 - Greg: i could mock you literally endlessly for it
10/01/2019, 17:52 - Will Green: I will only ever get one if I'm A, really rich and B, live in the middle of nowhere
10/01/2019, 17:53 - Will Green: neither of this things are likely to happen
10/01/2019, 17:53 - Will Green: Especially simultaneously
10/01/2019, 17:53 - Greg: imagine if youre so rich you can hire a driver to drive you around on it
10/01/2019, 17:53 - Greg: best of both worlds init
10/01/2019, 17:53 - Will Green: did I tell you about riding scoot?

10/01/2019, 18:03 - Greg: it looks fucking terrifying
10/01/2019, 18:03 - Greg: and youre relying on some poor person thats gotta cycle all day not to get you killed by a car

23/01/2019, 16:31 - Greg: There's nothing specific
23/01/2019, 16:31 - Greg: There's that one on Wednesday night
23/01/2019, 16:32 - Greg: But I'm still not decided if I have the arsed to go
23/01/2019, 16:32 - Greg: I do want to see them though
23/01/2019, 16:56 - Will Green: I didn't even know that it there was a season for gigs
23/01/2019, 17:11 - Greg: Yeah it's weird

23/01/2019, 17:11 - Greg: I'm going to do that thing again
23/01/2019, 17:11 - Greg: Just as my legs have become normal
23/01/2019, 17:11 - Will Green: I see
23/01/2019, 17:11 - Greg: But
23/01/2019, 17:12 - Greg: I'll be around at some point
23/01/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: you were back pretty early last time
23/01/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: i doubt i'll be on until like half 7 anyway
23/01/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: i is on now
23/01/2019, 19:39 - Greg: i want to do some stuff on loonix for a bit
23/01/2019, 19:39 - Greg: actually
23/01/2019, 19:39 - Greg: ill see if i can fix my mic
23/01/2019, 19:39 - Greg: then best of both worlds
23/01/2019, 19:40 - Greg: also what do you do with your dumbells at home
23/01/2019, 19:40 - Greg: i have some sitting around
23/01/2019, 19:40 - Greg: that i may as well make use of
23/01/2019, 19:40 - Greg: was it stuff that windows 98 told you to do
23/01/2019, 19:40 - Greg: or did you just google it
23/01/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: huh
23/01/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: windows 98?
23/01/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: oh
23/01/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: ffs
23/01/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: that was a stretch
23/01/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: I mainly just do arms at home with dumbells
23/01/2019, 19:43 - Will Green: bicep curls, hammer curls, rows, extensions and lateral raises
23/01/2019, 19:44 - Will Green: bicep curls works the peak of your bicep and your forearms, hammer curls works your forearms a bit more (and the tendons between that and your bicep area) and mainly a muscle called the brachialis
23/01/2019, 19:44 - Will Green: rows work your triceps
23/01/2019, 19:44 - Will Green: and your lats
23/01/2019, 19:44 - Will Green: extensions are the same
23/01/2019, 19:45 - Will Green: and lateral raises work your delts
23/01/2019, 19:45 - Will Green: so basically with those you hit your entire arm
23/01/2019, 19:45 - Will Green: and your shoulders a bit
23/01/2019, 19:45 - Will Green: can do shoulder presses too
23/01/2019, 19:45 - Will Green: and shrugs to hit your traps
23/01/2019, 20:02 - Greg: right
23/01/2019, 20:02 - Greg: why don't lateral raises work your lats
23/01/2019, 20:02 - Greg: actually I'll just look it up
23/01/2019, 20:09 - Will Green: because in that context it's just referring to the movement
23/01/2019, 20:10 - Will Green: it's nothing to do with your lats
23/01/2019, 20:10 - Will Green: you raise the dumbells laterally
23/01/2019, 20:15 - Greg: dang I wanted to find my longs
23/01/2019, 20:21 - Will Green: Huh
23/01/2019, 20:23 - Greg: i know where my lats are
23/01/2019, 20:24 - Greg: now onto my longs
23/01/2019, 20:24 - Greg: then i know the location of my bodyt
23/01/2019, 20:26 - Will Green: I see
23/01/2019, 20:26 - Greg: i feel like you dont get the joke
23/01/2019, 20:27 - Greg: otherwise you would be laughing
23/01/2019, 20:31 - Will Green: yeah

24/01/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: I mean... You've eaten fucking nothing
24/01/2019, 16:59 - Greg: i just yeeted down some mixed nuts
24/01/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: Eat meats, beans, lentils, nuts, wholegrains
24/01/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: Dairy
24/01/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: That's why people use whey
24/01/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: It makes it way easier to hit your macros
24/01/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: See what I did there
24/01/2019, 17:00 - Greg: yeah that was a proper zinger
24/01/2019, 17:01 - Will Green: You can just add whey powder to anything and increase the protein content
24/01/2019, 17:01 - Greg: what does it taste like
24/01/2019, 17:01 - Will Green: Depends
24/01/2019, 17:01 - Will Green: Unflavoured doesn't really taste of much
24/01/2019, 17:01 - Will Green: I get a chocolate flavoured one
24/01/2019, 17:01 - Greg: mmmmmm
24/01/2019, 17:01 - Will Green: Just have it with water in a shaker
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Greg: sprinkle that shit on my £30 cut of beef
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: It's so fucking cheap too
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Greg: so much protein
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: If you compare it to chicken
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: Or whatever
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Greg: what
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: Price per gram of protein is insanely low
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Greg: whey is cheaper than chicken
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Greg: see this is why i go to you for advice
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: Eat tuna too
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: And salmon
24/01/2019, 17:02 - Greg: you make sure i dont require a fundamental understanding of anything
24/01/2019, 17:03 - Greg: so what does eating more protein do
24/01/2019, 17:03 - Greg: does it make you b i g
24/01/2019, 17:05 - Will Green: you should watch those videos I sent
24/01/2019, 17:05 - Will Green: but basically the tldr is that when you workout you damage muscle fibers
24/01/2019, 17:05 - Will Green: your body rebuilds them to be stronger
24/01/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: but in order to rebuild them, your body goes through a process called protein synthesis
24/01/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: which requires there to be protein in your system
24/01/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: to rebuild
24/01/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: so eating high protein diets is only really necessary if you're working out
24/01/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: or if you're eating in a caloric deficit (trying to lose weight). In this case, you'd do it to maintain muscle mass while losing body fat simultaneously
24/01/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: i'm on 160g of protein a day
24/01/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: and I do intermittent fasting to maximise the amount of fat my body burns instead of muscle during that window
24/01/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: this means that my eating window is between 12pm and 8pm
24/01/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: so between those hours I need to get 160g of protein
24/01/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: and your body can't use more than 30g of protein per meal
24/01/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: so I have many small meals throughout that window to maximise the amount of protein my body can use for synthesis
24/01/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: does that make sense?
24/01/2019, 17:11 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
24/01/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: I don't track sodium btw
24/01/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: that's why it's 2k over
24/01/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: lol
24/01/2019, 17:12 - Greg: ur so close to your macros
24/01/2019, 17:13 - Will Green: that's fine
24/01/2019, 17:13 - Will Green: +/- 5% is fine
24/01/2019, 17:13 - Will Green: as long as you're consistent
24/01/2019, 17:13 - Greg: hmmmm
24/01/2019, 17:13 - Greg: i dont think ill be consistant
24/01/2019, 17:14 - Greg: maybe i will
24/01/2019, 17:14 - Greg: who knows
24/01/2019, 17:14 - Greg: maybe ill snarf down a can of lentils for dinner
24/01/2019, 17:14 - Will Green: just try tracking for a bit
24/01/2019, 17:15 - Greg: aight
24/01/2019, 17:15 - Greg: wait
24/01/2019, 17:15 - Greg: what
24/01/2019, 17:15 - Greg: i read yours wrong
24/01/2019, 17:16 - Greg: you used 100g of peri peri sauce with dinner?
24/01/2019, 17:16 - Greg: what the fuck
24/01/2019, 17:16 - Greg: whats so much
24/01/2019, 17:16 - Greg: thats*
24/01/2019, 17:18 - Will Green: it's probably wrong
24/01/2019, 17:18 - Will Green: probably more like 50g
24/01/2019, 17:18 - Greg: thats an insane amount of salt
24/01/2019, 17:18 - Greg: for a bit of sauce
24/01/2019, 17:19 - Will Green: yeah, i feel like their macros for it might be wrong
24/01/2019, 17:20 - Greg: hhmm
24/01/2019, 17:20 - Greg: according to the website its even worse for you
24/01/2019, 17:20 - Greg: 100g of it has 6g of salt
24/01/2019, 17:20 - Greg: not 2.4
24/01/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: Hmmm
24/01/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: Maybe I should cut that out
24/01/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: What about sriracha
24/01/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: ?
24/01/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: Tbf the rest of my diet is really really low in salt
24/01/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: Why is it so high in salt
24/01/2019, 17:26 - Will Green: That's insane
24/01/2019, 17:26 - Greg: basically all hot sauce has shit loads of salt
24/01/2019, 17:26 - Greg: it just makes it stay longer
24/01/2019, 17:26 - Will Green: Peak
24/01/2019, 17:26 - Greg: i made some out of some chillis i grew
24/01/2019, 17:26 - Greg: and it had like
24/01/2019, 17:26 - Greg: barely any in
24/01/2019, 17:27 - Greg: it was top shit
24/01/2019, 17:27 - Greg: but it only lasted like a week
24/01/2019, 17:27 - Will Green: There must be a brand that's low in salt
24/01/2019, 17:27 - Will Green: Surely there's a market for that
24/01/2019, 17:27 - Greg: yeah there probably will be
24/01/2019, 17:28 - Greg: but itll probably taste like shit
24/01/2019, 17:28 - Greg: maybe swap it out for some other kind of sauce
24/01/2019, 17:28 - Greg: you should make your way to soy sauce
24/01/2019, 17:28 - Greg: its got fuck loads of salt
24/01/2019, 17:28 - Greg: but you only use like a splash of it
24/01/2019, 18:31 - Will Green: Hmmm
24/01/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: Could try soy sauce
24/01/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: It's a bit samey though
24/01/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: And sort of
24/01/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: Dull

25/01/2019, 11:42 - Will Green: maybe it's because it's totally different to everything else they've produced
25/01/2019, 11:43 - Greg: maybe building a fan base around a style and then just abandoning it isn't the best idea
25/01/2019, 11:43 - Will Green: who'd have thunk it

26/01/2019, 20:11 - Greg: whatever muscle
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: Keep that protein intake up
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: And rest
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: That's why you should have two days between training
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Greg: if you put your hand palm up
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: For a specific muscle group
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Greg: whatever muscle is on the top of your forearm
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Greg: near the elbow
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: Oh that's totally natural
26/01/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: That happened to me
26/01/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: Just rest
26/01/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: And then go again
26/01/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: That'll fade
26/01/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: Your forearms are just weak
26/01/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: Comparatively

26/01/2019, 21:40 - Greg: That's good that shows actual use of the product
26/01/2019, 21:40 - Greg: You should find a body of water if possible

28/01/2019, 09:23 - Greg: nice
28/01/2019, 09:23 - Greg: using your powerful wings to generate thrust
28/01/2019, 09:24 - Will Green: Wardor gets so pissed off cause I just end up flying around with the bar between sets
28/01/2019, 09:27 - Greg: you should grow your toenails out so you can strike people with aerial attacks
28/01/2019, 09:28 - Will Green: Ah but you see then I can't climb
28/01/2019, 09:28 - Greg: why would you climb
28/01/2019, 09:28 - Greg: a flap of your wings and your height wont be dependent on plebbs bits of tall earth
28/01/2019, 09:29 - Greg: plebby
28/01/2019, 09:30 - Will Green: True
28/01/2019, 09:30 - Will Green: That's a great inspirational quote
28/01/2019, 09:30 - Will Green: Might get it framed
28/01/2019, 09:30 - Greg: put it on a mug
28/01/2019, 09:30 - Greg: next to your im nice at ping pong mug
28/01/2019, 09:30 - Will Green: ~ Greg Leonard, 2019
28/01/2019, 09:31 - Will Green: The typo ruins it
28/01/2019, 09:31 - Greg: no you can fix that
28/01/2019, 09:31 - Will Green: Send it again with proper grammar
28/01/2019, 09:31 - Greg: a flap of your wings and your height wont be dependent on plebbs [sic] bits of tall earth - Greg Leonard, 2019
28/01/2019, 09:32 - Greg: the sic make it look offical
28/01/2019, 09:32 - Greg: or does it go before the word
28/01/2019, 09:32 - Greg: probably before
28/01/2019, 09:32 - Greg: a flap of your wings and your height wont be dependent on plebby bits of tall earth
28/01/2019, 09:38 - Greg: i can finally straighten my arms without muscle pain
28/01/2019, 09:38 - Greg: its only taken me 5 days to recover
28/01/2019, 09:41 - Will Green: Wow
28/01/2019, 09:41 - Will Green: That'll go down
28/01/2019, 09:41 - Will Green: Should be 2 days tops after you're trained
28/01/2019, 09:43 - Greg: impressive right
28/01/2019, 09:56 - Greg: It's telling me to weigh myself
28/01/2019, 09:56 - Greg: Waddya think
28/01/2019, 09:56 - Greg: Up or down
28/01/2019, 09:56 - Will Green: huh
28/01/2019, 09:56 - Will Green: you should weigh yourself every morning at the same time
28/01/2019, 09:56 - Will Green: then take the mean of the 7 days every week
28/01/2019, 09:56 - Will Green: only compare averaged weights per week
28/01/2019, 09:57 - Will Green: anything between that doesn't account for natural fluctuations in weight from hydration, etc.
28/01/2019, 09:58 - Greg: Interesting
28/01/2019, 09:58 - Greg: I have not done thwtn
28/01/2019, 09:58 - Greg: Thwt
28/01/2019, 09:58 - Greg: That
28/01/2019, 09:59 - Will Green: You should definitely do that
28/01/2019, 09:59 - Will Green: it's one of the most important things
28/01/2019, 09:59 - Will Green: cause your calculated BMR from MFP may be inaccurate
28/01/2019, 09:59 - Will Green: everyone is different
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Will Green: for example, if MFP suggests you eat at a 500cal deficit to lose 0.5kg a week, but you end up losing 1kg, then you should increase your calorie intake
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Will Green: or you'll fuck your matabolism
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Will Green: metabolism
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Greg: Bruh you can't just throw acronyms my way
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Will Green: and lose muscle
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Will Green: instead of fat
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Will Green: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Greg: I got mfp
28/01/2019, 10:00 - Greg: Ah
28/01/2019, 10:01 - Will Green: Basically like idle calorie burn
28/01/2019, 11:22 - Will Green: there's a formula for figuring it out
28/01/2019, 11:22 - Will Green: you can find spreadsheets that do it
28/01/2019, 11:22 - Will Green: pretty helpful
28/01/2019, 11:32 - Will Green: hopefully the snow that's forecast later on in the week won't cuck your train journey
28/01/2019, 12:05 - Greg: Oh yeah shit when's that forecast for
28/01/2019, 12:10 - Will Green: Tomorrow night

28/01/2019, 12:10 - Will Green: Hopefully gone by Thursday
28/01/2019, 12:26 - Greg: Will it be able to get through the pollution anyway
28/01/2019, 12:37 - Will Green: True
28/01/2019, 12:37 - Will Green: Probably not
28/01/2019, 12:37 - Will Green: The gas bubble will save us

04/02/2019, 10:36 - Greg: kek
04/02/2019, 10:36 - Greg: that's so gunna be shut down
04/02/2019, 10:40 - Will Green: why?
04/02/2019, 10:41 - Greg: wait is it like
04/02/2019, 10:41 - Greg: hosted on drive
04/02/2019, 10:41 - Will Green: it's a google sheet
04/02/2019, 10:41 - Will Green: ye
04/02/2019, 10:42 - Greg: yeah but I wasn't sure if it just got it from a Google sheet then gave you a thing you stuck on your own hosting
04/02/2019, 10:42 - Greg: So if anything biggish uses it Googled gunna be all like
04/02/2019, 10:42 - Greg: Dis nigga using all our bandwidth for free
04/02/2019, 10:45 - Will Green: oh I see
04/02/2019, 10:45 - Will Green: i think they've already accounted for this
04/02/2019, 10:45 - Will Green: for normal sheets usage
04/02/2019, 10:45 - Will Green: i think there's a cap for the free tier
04/02/2019, 10:45 - Will Green: so people will just hit those limits quicker
04/02/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: so they'll make more money if anything
04/02/2019, 10:46 - Greg: Oh so it's an actual feature of it but that just makes it easier
04/02/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: well, google doesn't intend for you to use it as a backend
04/02/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: and they might not be okay with that for data protection reasons
04/02/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: but it won't cost them any money
04/02/2019, 10:47 - Will Green: because they charge people who have loads of data already
04/02/2019, 10:47 - Will Green: regardless of whether it's accessed via their GUI or some janky API plugin someone's made
04/02/2019, 10:53 - Greg: but isn't it more about the amount of people that access the data rather than the actual size of the db
04/02/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: I guess they've also accounted for that in their pricing
04/02/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: Number of users I suspect
04/02/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: And yeah, with an API you'd hit that limit very fast
04/02/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: Unless you have some middle layer elsewhere
04/02/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: Like we have with Wellth
04/02/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: Something that polls all endpoints and caches the data
04/02/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: So you don't have thousands of clients all sending api requests to the same endpoints simultaneously
04/02/2019, 11:22 - Will Green: can you help me
04/02/2019, 11:23 - Will Green: find a funny name for my snooker cue
04/02/2019, 13:09 - Greg: Is that possible

04/02/2019, 14:58 - Will Green: cause it sounds funny
04/02/2019, 17:22 - Greg: trying to give something an intentionally funny name is almost always cringy
04/02/2019, 17:22 - Greg: just call it the yeeter or some bullshit
04/02/2019, 17:22 - Greg: at least thats ironic
04/02/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: Jesus
04/02/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: It has to be ironic
04/02/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: Obviously

04/02/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: Irony?
04/02/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: A yeet is the only thing that cannot be ironic
04/02/2019, 17:23 - Greg: what are you talkin about nigga

08/02/2019, 22:39 - Will Green: Sorry dude
08/02/2019, 22:39 - Will Green: Thank you for understanding senpaj
08/02/2019, 23:11 - Greg: Oh no I don't know who to have emotions at
08/02/2019, 23:11 - Greg: It's usually her but it's about her??
08/02/2019, 23:12 - Greg: Basically it's just we live far apart and are both into each other
08/02/2019, 23:12 - Greg: There is no solution
08/02/2019, 23:12 - Greg: Thank u for ur rubber ducking will senpai that will be all
08/02/2019, 23:17 - Will Green: I'm half asleep
08/02/2019, 23:17 - Will Green: And somewhat confused by this
08/02/2019, 23:17 - Will Green: I shall assess in the morning and offer some sort of reckon
08/02/2019, 23:17 - Will Green: Stay strong brother
08/02/2019, 23:17 - Greg: I'm accepting of a morning reckon
09/02/2019, 12:15 - Will Green: I reckon you should continue talking to her
09/02/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: things change, maybe she'll move or you'll move and then suddenly it'll be viable
09/02/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: and long distance can work too... Especially if it starts like that
09/02/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: much harder to go from seeing eachother every day to being long distance than the other way around
09/02/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: if you like eachother that much to enter in to a long distance relationship from the start then it definitely means something
09/02/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: so just see where it goes, continue to see her and if you think it could work, ask her out
09/02/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: that's my two cents
09/02/2019, 12:17 - Will Green: my uninformed reckon#
09/02/2019, 12:17 - Will Green: you're welcome
09/02/2019, 18:10 - Will Green: E?

14/02/2019, 14:45 - Will Green: arms shouldn't really effect your blank
14/02/2019, 14:45 - Will Green: might be your shoulders or back
14/02/2019, 14:46 - Greg: maybe
14/02/2019, 14:46 - Greg: but my arms get tired from holding myself up
14/02/2019, 14:46 - Greg: so i suspect its my arms
14/02/2019, 14:46 - Will Green: I'd recommend just starting a proper split/program

14/02/2019, 14:48 - Will Green: based on the kit you've got at home

14/02/2019, 14:53 - Will Green: a kettlebell would be really great

14/02/2019, 14:54 - Greg: how heavy
14/02/2019, 15:09 - Will Green: Push/Pull/Legs

Monday - HIIT sprints
Go for a run, but don’t do steady state. Do intervals of 1 min sprinting, 1 min 15 secs walking, repeat. Do 10-20 sets of this. Aim to get your heart rate up near topping out during the high intensity interval and then walk slowly and try to drop your heart rate as low as possible during the low intensity interval. You’ll burn more fat in a shorter period of time by fluctuating your heart rate and it’ll be better for you cardio-wise. Your legs won’t get so fucked either.
Crunch - 4 * 12
Laying leg raises - 4 * 12
Plank - 4 * 30 secs

14/02/2019, 15:12 - Greg: righto
14/02/2019, 15:12 - Greg: time to find me a kettle
14/02/2019, 15:12 - Will Green: I'd suggest warming up before all of these
14/02/2019, 15:12 - Will Green: obviously not the cardio day
14/02/2019, 15:12 - Will Green: but the others
14/02/2019, 15:12 - Will Green: just do some mountain climbers or jumping jacks to get your heart rate up a bit
14/02/2019, 15:12 - Will Green: for like 5 mins or something
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: you'll perform the lifts better if you warm up first
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: easier to get a pump
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: I got for a 5 min run before every workout
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: also, make sure you eat something before each
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: I normally have a banana and a rice cake
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: bit of quick carbs basically
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Greg: mm rice cake
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: then eat a high protein meal after
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: or a shake
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: if you're lazy
14/02/2019, 15:13 - Will Green: like me
14/02/2019, 15:14 - Greg: hmm i am lazy
14/02/2019, 15:14 - Greg: maybe i need many kg of whey
14/02/2019, 15:14 - Will Green: whey is fantastic
14/02/2019, 15:14 - Will Green: it's so fucking cheap
14/02/2019, 15:14 - Will Green: it's insane
14/02/2019, 15:14 - Will Green: idk why everyone doesn't have it daily
14/02/2019, 15:14 - Will Green: it's like the cheapest, most convenient food
14/02/2019, 15:15 - Will Green: if you get a kettlebell you can try kettlebell cleans too
14/02/2019, 15:15 - Greg: dw m8 im gunna polish that boi daily
14/02/2019, 15:16 - Will Green: lol
14/02/2019, 15:16 - Will Green: one other thing - once you start, make sure you're progressively overloading
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: when you start out you'll make decent nooby gains
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: so you should be able to up the weight pretty much every other week
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Greg: oof ok
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: that's why it's a good idea to have other plates around
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: smaller ones
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: so you can gradually add weight
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Greg: aight
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: google 'progressive overload'
14/02/2019, 15:17 - Greg: maybe ill hit up garage man

14/02/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: it should have all those exercises
14/02/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: so just make three custom workouts
14/02/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: and add those in
14/02/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: use it to track the weight progression
14/02/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: because it's important to know how you're progressing on the weight front
14/02/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: and also motivating
14/02/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: when you see the graph
14/02/2019, 15:21 - Greg: oh yeah
14/02/2019, 15:21 - Will Green: and you're like "oh shit, I can actually life like 5kg more than I could a month ago on that lift"
14/02/2019, 15:21 - Greg: how exciting

14/02/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: cool
14/02/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: if you want to maximise the gains you make, the only real diet change you have to make is to make sure you get enough protein
14/02/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: the ideal is 20-30g of protein every 3 hours
14/02/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: and don't skimp on carbs to compensate
14/02/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: especially pre-workout
14/02/2019, 15:25 - Greg: how do i do incline press without like
14/02/2019, 15:25 - Greg: an inclined bench
14/02/2019, 15:27 - Greg: oh actually my desk chair leans back nicely
14/02/2019, 15:27 - Greg: i can probably just use that

14/02/2019, 20:53 - Greg: i got to 9
14/02/2019, 20:53 - Will Green: Yeah I put them at the end because I knew it would take you to failure
14/02/2019, 20:53 - Will Green: Which is good
14/02/2019, 20:53 - Greg: i think everything else was fine
14/02/2019, 20:53 - Greg: i used 10 for everything
14/02/2019, 20:53 - Greg: apart from lat raise and tricep extension
14/02/2019, 20:53 - Greg: which were 5
14/02/2019, 20:53 - Will Green: Warpus made me do 60 push ups at the end of training this morning
14/02/2019, 20:54 - Will Green: The last three reps took me about 15 minutes
14/02/2019, 20:54 - Greg: that sounds awful
14/02/2019, 20:54 - Will Green: Yeah lateral raises are fucking brutal
14/02/2019, 20:54 - Will Green: Gotta go super low weight on them
14/02/2019, 20:54 - Will Green: I only do 4kg for laterals
14/02/2019, 20:54 - Greg: oh hecc
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: If you ever find an exercise hard, you can do negatives too
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: They're great for starting off
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Greg: as in
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Greg: go down
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Greg: rather than up
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: As in, go up really fast with bad form
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: Then control coming down slowly
14/02/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: Don't do as many reps
14/02/2019, 20:56 - Will Green: Negatives are great for pull ups
14/02/2019, 20:56 - Will Green: Jump up
14/02/2019, 20:56 - Will Green: Then slowly let yourself down
14/02/2019, 20:56 - Greg: i slowly let myself down every day already

24/02/2019, 12:42 - Greg: nice front page meme
24/02/2019, 12:42 - Greg: if things are getting too easy should I add reps or weight
24/02/2019, 12:42 - Greg: or both
24/02/2019, 12:43 - Greg: or do they do different things
24/02/2019, 12:57 - Will Green: Weight usually
24/02/2019, 12:57 - Will Green: If you want to build size
24/02/2019, 12:57 - Will Green: Progressive overload
24/02/2019, 12:58 - Greg: eh
24/02/2019, 12:58 - Greg: im not bothered about being hueg
24/02/2019, 12:58 - Greg: my goal is to not to look like a man sized baby
24/02/2019, 12:58 - Will Green: I'd increase the weight a bit
24/02/2019, 12:58 - Will Green: But not loads
24/02/2019, 12:58 - Will Green: Are you doing 4x12?
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: After a while is cut the number of reps down
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Greg: for most things yeah
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: Depends on the lift
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: But for compound stuff
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: You want to get heavier
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: And reduce reps
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: So chest press for example
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Greg: can i do it exponentially
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: Go heavier
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Greg: can i do 1/256th of a rep at 900kg
24/02/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: I guess
24/02/2019, 13:00 - Will Green: I'd be very impressed

24/02/2019, 13:00 - Greg: also
24/02/2019, 13:00 - Greg: what is compound
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Greg: youre firing out memes at an exponential rate
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: It's when a movement uses multiple muscles across two joints
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: I think
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: Basically when you use a few muscles in a chain
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Greg: how do you even do a non compound exercise
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: Rather than isolating one muscle
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Greg: dont you have to use more than one muscle for basically everything
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: A bicep curl is isolated
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Greg: like stabilisation n shit
24/02/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: If you're doing it right
24/02/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: Like a preacher curl
24/02/2019, 13:02 - Greg: i guess if youre using your arm blaster
24/02/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: Yeah
24/02/2019, 13:02 - Greg: you can blast that bi
24/02/2019, 13:02 - Greg: BOOM

08/03/2019, 20:19 - Will Green: Like what do you want to track
08/03/2019, 20:19 - Greg: mostly heart rate
08/03/2019, 20:19 - Greg: to see dat fitness
08/03/2019, 20:19 - Greg: i guess calories?
08/03/2019, 20:19 - Greg: but im not really bothered about that
08/03/2019, 20:20 - Greg: i stopped tracking them on my fitness pal
08/03/2019, 20:20 - Greg: because i wasnt doing anything with it
08/03/2019, 20:20 - Greg: apart from just putting the stuff i ate in for no reaosn
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: cool
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: yeah
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: tbh
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: the most useful tracker to get is a wifi scale
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: that's the most helpful thing i've got by a mile
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: I have a fitbit alta HR
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: which is the best one of the lot
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Will Green: it's pretty small and tracks heart rate, sleep and steps
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Will Green: battery lasts a whole week
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Will Green: but I don't think it's that worth it tbh
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Will Green: I'm thinking of getting rid of it
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Will Green: going back to an apple watch
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Will Green: because Strong on apple watch is so fucking good
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Greg: kek
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Greg: well im not getting an apple watch
08/03/2019, 20:27 - Greg: maybe ill just not bother
08/03/2019, 20:27 - Greg: im not sure if its really worth it
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Greg: strong does a good job of tracking progress
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Will Green: honestly just get a scale
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Will Green: i've got an old one, but it doesn't do bodyfat
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Will Green: it's just the weight one
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Greg: oh
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Greg: but im not after that weight loss yakno
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Will Green: well then that aint worth it either
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Will Green: i'd just go without any of it then
08/03/2019, 20:28 - Will Green: what is your goal though?
08/03/2019, 20:29 - Greg: to not look like a giant baby
08/03/2019, 20:30 - Greg: and i guess something something good habits
08/03/2019, 20:31 - Greg: cus once I get that sweet inactive desk job I'll just become fat again if I don't do anything
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: I see
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: hmmm
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: a fitbit might not be a bad idea then
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: the steps are pretty good for that
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: it's a good gauge of how active you are overall
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: HR is only useful if you're doing intense cardio really
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: or HIIT
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Will Green: /circuits
08/03/2019, 20:36 - Greg: thats sorta what made me think of it
08/03/2019, 20:36 - Greg: cus i was doing circuits today and found it way easier
08/03/2019, 20:36 - Greg: and im not sure if im actually fitter
08/03/2019, 20:37 - Greg: or if it was just easier
08/03/2019, 20:40 - Will Green: it takes quite a while before your heartrate starts to change
08/03/2019, 20:41 - Will Green: a more significant change will be recovery time
08/03/2019, 20:41 - Will Green: i.e. if you're not as shattered after
08/03/2019, 20:41 - Will Green: and if you can actually do shit the following day
08/03/2019, 20:41 - Will Green: resting heart rate over time is OK but nothing to write home about
08/03/2019, 20:43 - Greg: i mean like
08/03/2019, 20:43 - Greg: i can see how hard im working based on heart rate right?
08/03/2019, 20:43 - Greg: maybe
08/03/2019, 20:43 - Greg: i made that up
08/03/2019, 20:43 - Greg: but it sounds true
08/03/2019, 20:44 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 20:44 - Will Green: Yeah you can
08/03/2019, 20:44 - Will Green: <Media omitted>

08/03/2019, 20:44 - Will Green: Walking home and going to the gym at the end
08/03/2019, 20:45 - Greg: so i should be able to see how much im doin
08/03/2019, 20:45 - Greg: if i keep track of that
08/03/2019, 20:45 - Greg: i guess
08/03/2019, 20:45 - Greg: im still not entirely confident of why i want this
08/03/2019, 20:45 - Will Green: yep
08/03/2019, 20:45 - Greg: but it seems like an idea

13/03/2019, 14:46 - Greg: I mean what do you expect really
13/03/2019, 14:47 - Will Green: Can you please set up Monzo
13/03/2019, 14:47 - Will Green: Lending you money is the most painful thing in the world
13/03/2019, 14:47 - Will Green: I think it would be beneficial for you to make it easier for me to lend you money
13/03/2019, 14:47 - Will Green: Given that I seem to do it all the time
13/03/2019, 14:47 - Greg: Yeah I've considered it
13/03/2019, 14:47 - Greg: Perhaps I will
13/03/2019, 14:48 - Will Green: I want to die
13/03/2019, 14:49 - Greg: Can I have your arm blaster if you do an hero
13/03/2019, 14:49 - Greg: Or so you want to be posed with it at your funeral
13/03/2019, 15:56 - Will Green: the latter
13/03/2019, 15:56 - Will Green: obviously
13/03/2019, 15:56 - Will Green: Gotta show off them swans

14/03/2019, 13:50 - Will Green: so popular
14/03/2019, 14:25 - Greg: Be the most popular person in your office
14/03/2019, 14:25 - Greg: Do people really think like that
14/03/2019, 14:25 - Will Green: I think so
14/03/2019, 14:25 - Will Green: Worryingly
14/03/2019, 14:26 - Greg: I've never met anyone and thought
14/03/2019, 14:26 - Greg: Boy I'm so close to wanting to be their friend but they're just not interesting enough
14/03/2019, 14:27 - Greg: If only their card was made of a harder material that would push it over the edge
14/03/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: Hahaha
14/03/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: I just assume anyone with one is an almighty cunt
14/03/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: It's like £12 a month or something
14/03/2019, 14:28 - Greg: lol what
14/03/2019, 14:29 - Will Green: https://www.revolut.com/introducing-revolut-metal
14/03/2019, 14:29 - Greg: the people that run revolut must be pissing themselves on the way to the bank
14/03/2019, 14:29 - Will Green: £12.99 a month
14/03/2019, 14:29 - Will Green: minimum 24 month contract
14/03/2019, 14:29 - Will Green: so you're committed to 12.99 a month for two years
14/03/2019, 14:30 - Will Green: absolutely fucking insane
14/03/2019, 14:30 - Greg: Holy shit what
14/03/2019, 14:30 - Will Green: it infuriates me that there are people out there with so much money that they pay for things like this
14/03/2019, 14:30 - Greg: 3 grand for having a metal card for 2 years
14/03/2019, 14:30 - Will Green: imagine if that money was given to people that actually need it
14/03/2019, 14:30 - Will Green: it's actually disgusting
14/03/2019, 14:30 - Greg: yes brother
14/03/2019, 14:31 - Will Green: £300 for two years

14/03/2019, 14:32 - Greg: i can now pick up my card with a magnet
14/03/2019, 14:32 - Will Green: they're so kind
14/03/2019, 14:32 - Will Green: and generous
14/03/2019, 14:32 - Greg: and humble
14/03/2019, 14:33 - Will Green: very humble
14/03/2019, 14:33 - Will Green: you don't even know how humble they are
14/03/2019, 14:34 - Greg: they have no way of showing it
14/03/2019, 14:35 - Greg: I'm sure they don't slap their card down as hard as possible to make sure people even hear that the sound waves it generates are superiort
14/03/2019, 14:53 - Will Green: Totally deffening anyone in the area
14/03/2019, 18:04 - Greg: my fellow of colour

16/03/2019, 21:29 - Will Green: Just chilling
17/03/2019, 15:18 - Greg: Am I doomed to eternal sore legs
17/03/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: Nah
17/03/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: It'll fade
17/03/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: Although not if you're squatting loads
17/03/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: That'll take a while
17/03/2019, 15:31 - Greg: Oh dang
17/03/2019, 15:32 - Greg: Well I'm doing lots of squatting every third day
17/03/2019, 15:32 - Greg: So maybe once I plateau
17/03/2019, 15:49 - Will Green: Yeah you should be okay
17/03/2019, 15:49 - Will Green: Plus you're not doing it with a barbell
17/03/2019, 15:49 - Will Green: So it shouldn't be as bad
17/03/2019, 15:49 - Will Green: Cause the weight is more consistently located centrally
17/03/2019, 15:49 - Will Green: I mean
17/03/2019, 15:49 - Will Green: There's less variance
17/03/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: So you don't end up using your core
17/03/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: Or unevenly using one leg or a certain muscle
17/03/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: That inconsistency makes DOMs after squatting with a barbell relentless
17/03/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: Until your form is perfect every time
17/03/2019, 15:50 - Greg: Who is dom
17/03/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: Which it never is really
17/03/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: Delayed onset muscle soreness
17/03/2019, 15:51 - Greg: damn doms
17/03/2019, 15:51 - Greg: anyway my core is thick like tree
17/03/2019, 15:51 - Greg: it turns out being skinny means I can skip those months you spent losing the weight in the first place
17/03/2019, 15:52 - Greg: ballin
17/03/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: I thought you said doms doms for a sec
17/03/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: Which would've been funny
17/03/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: Yep
17/03/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: Jammy git
17/03/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: Means you're probably a hard gainer tho
17/03/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: So you'll have to eat loads to gain muscle
17/03/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: Rip you
17/03/2019, 15:54 - Greg: Oh no how awful
17/03/2019, 15:54 - Will Green: It's worse than it sounds
17/03/2019, 15:54 - Will Green: Trust me
17/03/2019, 15:55 - Will Green: Get back to me when you can't put on muscle and you're eating a painful amount of protein every day
17/03/2019, 15:55 - Will Green: Mmmmm so much tuna and chicken
17/03/2019, 15:55 - Will Green: 8 meaps every day because my metabolism is good
17/03/2019, 15:55 - Greg: Mmm sounds awful
17/03/2019, 15:56 - Greg: I don't wanna get big like a bull anyway
17/03/2019, 15:56 - Greg: More like a fast chicken
17/03/2019, 16:08 - Will Green: ya but unfortunately you'll still need to build muscle my dude
17/03/2019, 16:09 - Greg: much like the tasty chicken
17/03/2019, 16:09 - Greg: which must build muscle to become succulent and jewsy like i shall
17/03/2019, 16:15 - Greg: broscience man finally got suggested on my youtube
17/03/2019, 16:15 - Greg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmmZULPUEkQ

17/03/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
17/03/2019, 16:18 - Greg: thank you for that screencap
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: pre workouts have a bad name because people take stupid shit without knowing what it does
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: like 1-3 dymeth
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: and then people die
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: it's just natural selection basically
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: it's fine
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Greg: but thats just like what bananas have
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: it's just another type of bcaa
17/03/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: makes you strong and shit
17/03/2019, 16:21 - Greg: and how can you argue with that
17/03/2019, 16:21 - Will Green: impossible
17/03/2019, 16:21 - Greg: i wonder if i should do ket swings with legs
17/03/2019, 16:21 - Greg: guide me darth
17/03/2019, 16:21 - Will Green: hmmm
17/03/2019, 16:21 - Greg: or just more squats and lunges
17/03/2019, 16:22 - Will Green: either do it on legs or pull
17/03/2019, 16:22 - Will Green: i find that kettlebell swings fuck up my lats
17/03/2019, 16:22 - Will Green: and my core
17/03/2019, 16:22 - Will Green: more than my legs
17/03/2019, 16:22 - Will Green: although they do fuck up my glutes
17/03/2019, 16:22 - Greg: hmmmm
17/03/2019, 16:22 - Greg: i think they can stay on pull
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Greg: cus if my legs are tired when im swinging around a bunch of weight
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Greg: is bad
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: i'd probably do it at the end of legs
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: actually
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: pull is just before legs
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: yeah
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: keep it on pull
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: and tbh your squats are probably pretty light atm
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: so working your glutes the day before probably aint bad
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Greg: they are
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Greg: i dont have enough mass
17/03/2019, 16:23 - Greg: i need more mass

24/03/2019, 13:28 - Greg: ive discovered a life hack
24/03/2019, 13:28 - Greg: if the things i lift are heavier
24/03/2019, 13:28 - Greg: it takes less time to do exercise

24/03/2019, 14:16 - Will Green: Wow
24/03/2019, 14:16 - Will Green: Has it really taken you this long to realise that
24/03/2019, 14:16 - Will Green: Jesus Christ
24/03/2019, 14:16 - Will Green: That's why people squat, bench and deadlift
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Will Green: 3*3 high weight
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Will Green: Quick 30 min gym session every other day
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Will Green: Bob's your uncle
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Will Green: Hahahahaha
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Will Green: Wtf
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Greg: b-b-but my functional strength
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Will Green: Is that guy doing
24/03/2019, 14:17 - Will Green: Compound lifts are functional
24/03/2019, 14:18 - Greg: i have no idea what functional even is
24/03/2019, 14:18 - Greg: surely making yourself stronger in any way makes day to day actions easier
24/03/2019, 14:19 - Will Green: Mhm
24/03/2019, 14:21 - Will Green: Functional just means doing movements that your body is designed to do I think
24/03/2019, 14:21 - Will Green: So it does broadly mean anything
24/03/2019, 14:21 - Will Green: But it also depends what you yourself do
24/03/2019, 14:21 - Will Green: Like, rugby players functional training is different to footballers
24/03/2019, 14:21 - Will Green: I think that's the general idea
24/03/2019, 19:58 - Will Green: We're on pubg btw
24/03/2019, 19:58 - Will Green: Pete and Rob
24/03/2019, 19:58 - Greg: o hecc

25/03/2019, 09:03 - Greg: You were right
25/03/2019, 09:03 - Greg: I should buy more weights
25/03/2019, 09:04 - Greg: I decided not to be lazy and do one arm at a time for my curls n shit
25/03/2019, 09:04 - Greg: and used 10 instead of 5
25/03/2019, 09:04 - Greg: now I can feel the gains brewing
25/03/2019, 09:04 - Greg: like a satisfying shit
25/03/2019, 09:04 - Greg: of muscle
25/03/2019, 10:02 - Will Green: you were curling 5kg?
25/03/2019, 10:02 - Will Green: That's nothing
25/03/2019, 10:02 - Greg: kek ikr
25/03/2019, 10:02 - Greg: i was just being lazy
25/03/2019, 10:02 - Will Green: what dumbbell were you holding when you were squatting?
25/03/2019, 10:02 - Greg: cus i didnt have 2 of more
25/03/2019, 10:02 - Greg: 15
25/03/2019, 10:03 - Greg: its all i can fit on it :(
25/03/2019, 10:03 - Will Green: that's not too awful
25/03/2019, 10:03 - Will Green: but like, i'm not very strong and I squat 80kg 10 reps * 3
25/03/2019, 10:03 - Will Green: so you can definitely squat like 50-60kg at least
25/03/2019, 10:03 - Will Green: you're missing out on them gains
25/03/2019, 10:03 - Greg: but that means buying hella weight
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Greg: which is an issue
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: just get a barbell
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Greg: just gotta find that jackpot of some clueless woman giving away a whole bunch of weight cus she doesnt want it around
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: and then buy like 2 *15kg plates
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: that's all you'd need
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: for deadlifting and squatting
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: cause a barbell is 20kg on its own
25/03/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: so 2 plates is 50kg
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Greg: quik maff
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: then you can just do higher and higher volume as you get stronger
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: or buy some extra plates if you need them later on
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: the main problem is having a rack
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Greg: ye
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: you need something to hold the bar at head height
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: maybe just buy a really heave dumbell
25/03/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: sorry, kettlebell
25/03/2019, 10:08 - Greg: https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/988164581573937/
25/03/2019, 10:08 - Greg: aw hell yeah
25/03/2019, 10:10 - Will Green: fucking hell
25/03/2019, 10:11 - Will Green: that would be hilarious
25/03/2019, 10:11 - Will Green: just get one of the small free standing ones that fold up
25/03/2019, 10:12 - Will Green: https://www.amazon.co.uk/DTX-Fitness-Squat-Stands-Adjustable/dp/B01LQ8MYO4/ref=cts_sp_4_vtp
25/03/2019, 10:12 - Will Green: can probably get one of those second hand for like £20
25/03/2019, 10:12 - Will Green: or something similar
25/03/2019, 10:12 - Will Green: then all you need is a barbell
25/03/2019, 10:15 - Greg: and probably a bench
25/03/2019, 10:15 - Greg: i doubt my little piano stool can hold like 120kg
25/03/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: yeah maybe
25/03/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: up to you, depends how heavy you plan on going
25/03/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: i wouldn't bench on your own though
25/03/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: with a barbell
25/03/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: you need a spotter really
25/03/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: i'd stick to dumbbells if you're lifting on your own
25/03/2019, 10:16 - Greg: aight
25/03/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: I mean, you could bench on your own if you had a smith machine
25/03/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: that's basically the whole point of them
25/03/2019, 10:18 - Greg: but then who knows how much ill be lifting
25/03/2019, 10:19 - Greg: its like lifting on the moon
25/03/2019, 10:19 - Greg: theres no gravity
25/03/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: but they're fucking huge and heavy, you'd need some sort of crane to get it to your house probably
25/03/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: smith machines are ridiculous
25/03/2019, 10:19 - Greg: someone will be selling some tasty weights for almost nothing somewhere
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Greg: then i can jack up my dumbells
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Will Green: yeah, if not just wait for them to pop up
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Greg: https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/354594442064169/
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Greg: also this dude is basically giving these away
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Greg: a new one is 60 quid from amazon for 24kg
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Will Green: i'm selling a kettlebell and my dumbbells atm
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Will Green: on gumtree
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Will Green: not that it would help you
25/03/2019, 10:20 - Will Green: need to get rid of them by the end of the week

25/03/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: yeah, kettlebells are only good for swings
25/03/2019, 10:23 - Greg: god my stablisers are gunna be so fucking stable
25/03/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: dumbbells and a barbell are what you need
25/03/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: imo
25/03/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: you could just get more plates for your dumbbells
25/03/2019, 10:23 - Greg: yeah im gunna get more plates either way

25/03/2019, 16:35 - Greg: not a pull up bar
25/03/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: Hahahaha
25/03/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: A door gym
25/03/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: Wow
25/03/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: Jesus
25/03/2019, 16:36 - Will Green: That's a lesson in marketing right there
25/03/2019, 16:37 - Greg: i cant find the door smith machine
25/03/2019, 17:01 - Will Green: damn son
25/03/2019, 17:01 - Will Green: that's all you need
25/03/2019, 17:21 - Greg: what was that thing you said to do
25/03/2019, 17:21 - Greg: is it just hanging leg raises
25/03/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: hanging leg raises, but you probably will only be able to do a few I suspect
25/03/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: so progress down to hanging knee raises
25/03/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: then do chin ups and pull ups. And do some pull ups with a supernated grip
25/03/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: i.e. rotated 90 degrees
25/03/2019, 17:22 - Will Green: like a hammer curl
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Greg: aight ill save them ones for pull
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Greg: doin push atm
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: do knee/leg raises every day
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: they're so good
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: also great for your grip strength
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Greg: yeah i do core stuff every day anyway
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Greg: should i do floor ones too
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: because you're hanging from the bar for ages
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Greg: or just chuck em
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: I do 4*12
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Greg: and do hangs
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: I do the floor ones after hangs
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: I do leg raises to failure
25/03/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: then knee raises to failure
25/03/2019, 17:24 - Will Green: then laying leg raises
25/03/2019, 17:24 - Will Green: progress down from hanging leg raises
25/03/2019, 17:24 - Will Green: then as yo get stronger you'll be able to see how many leg raises you can do
25/03/2019, 17:35 - Greg: do you do like
25/03/2019, 17:35 - Greg: sets to failure
25/03/2019, 17:35 - Greg: or just one until you cant do no mo
25/03/2019, 17:36 - Will Green: Sets to failure
25/03/2019, 17:36 - Will Green: Sets of 12
25/03/2019, 17:36 - Greg: aight
25/03/2019, 17:51 - Greg: how do i stop myself from swinging like a fucking top
25/03/2019, 17:51 - Will Green: Engadget your core
25/03/2019, 17:51 - Greg: thats a very autistic auto suggestion there
25/03/2019, 17:51 - Will Green: Control yourself up and down slowly
25/03/2019, 17:51 - Will Green: Don't swing
25/03/2019, 17:52 - Greg: <Media omitted>
25/03/2019, 17:52 - Greg: i was just looking up how to graip the bar
25/03/2019, 17:52 - Greg: why the fuck is that dudes head so small
25/03/2019, 17:52 - Greg: he looks like hes wearing a man suit

25/03/2019, 17:53 - Will Green: Looks like a chimp
25/03/2019, 17:53 - Greg: amazing

25/03/2019, 17:53 - Greg: hmmm
25/03/2019, 17:53 - Greg: maybe
25/03/2019, 17:53 - Will Green: That would be it
25/03/2019, 17:53 - Greg: i cant just hang from it legs down
25/03/2019, 17:53 - Greg: cus i just touch the floor
25/03/2019, 17:54 - Will Green: Hmmm
25/03/2019, 17:54 - Will Green: Maybe try leg raises
25/03/2019, 17:54 - Will Green: Or try and fix it higher up somewhere
25/03/2019, 17:54 - Will Green: Garage door maybe
25/03/2019, 17:55 - Greg: ive found a solution
25/03/2019, 17:55 - Greg: ive just gotta hold a chin up
25/03/2019, 17:55 - Greg: all my doors are the same height
25/03/2019, 17:55 - Will Green: That works
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Greg: wtf why is it so hard
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Will Green: You'll struggle to do that at the end of pull
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Greg: the top my my legs hurt now
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Will Green: I couldn't do a single leg raise when I started
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Will Green: They're hard
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Will Green: That's why they're good
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Greg: ive done 2 sets of 12 fine
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Greg: i think i can finish it already
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Greg: alright*
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Will Green: Leg raises or knee raises?
25/03/2019, 17:56 - Greg: leg

25/03/2019, 17:57 - Greg: yeah pointy like a ballerina
25/03/2019, 17:57 - Greg: and yeah i was making sure i was going slow

25/03/2019, 17:57 - Will Green: Damn son
25/03/2019, 17:57 - Will Green: If you can do 3 sets of 12 leg raises I'll be super impressed
25/03/2019, 17:57 - Will Green: Maybe you have really light legs
25/03/2019, 17:58 - Greg: well you have a smaller
25/03/2019, 17:58 - Greg: uhhh

02/04/2019, 16:09 - Greg: youre like a cheese that the skin they made for it turned out too small
02/04/2019, 16:09 - Greg: but they put it on anyway

04/04/2019, 14:58 - Greg: https://www.amazon.co.uk/PACK-Tidmans-Rock-Salt-BUNDLE/dp/B00V6HOM8W

04/04/2019, 15:01 - Greg: but i would reccomend olive

04/04/2019, 15:16 - Greg: depends what youre making my man
04/04/2019, 15:16 - Will Green: carrots, broccoli, cauliflower
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Greg: what just for on the side?
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: to go with rice and whatever meat
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: ya
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Greg: oh right
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: obvs will cook in a pan with other stuff
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Greg: if youre just doing that microwave em
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: mixed in
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: but in isolation
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: hmmm
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: can you do that with frozen veg?
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Greg: yeah
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Will Green: dope
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Greg: i do it all the time
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Greg: proper steaming is effort
04/04/2019, 15:17 - Greg: boiling takes ages
04/04/2019, 15:18 - Will Green: is there anywhere you can buy frozen veg in bulk?
04/04/2019, 15:18 - Will Green: guess you can't get it on amazon
04/04/2019, 15:18 - Greg: i dunno actually
04/04/2019, 15:18 - Greg: they do that grocery thing
04/04/2019, 15:18 - Greg: maybe they have food trucks
04/04/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Morrisons-Country-Vegetable-Mix-Frozen/dp/B01BM9E8NM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=FRAFD4T1FDX1&keywords=frozen+vegetable&ppl=fresh&qid=1554387527&s=gateway&sprefix=frozen+vegetables%2Caps%2C-1&sr=8-1
04/04/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: got a £20 limit
04/04/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: cba to hit that
04/04/2019, 15:19 - Greg: eh just get it from a shop
04/04/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: ya
04/04/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: will do that tomorrow
04/04/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: dope
04/04/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: i got some tupperware
04/04/2019, 15:20 - Will Green: gunna prep my foods
04/04/2019, 15:20 - Greg: id recommend getting separate frozen veg
04/04/2019, 15:20 - Greg: cus if you wanna make something that includes one of them you can use it
04/04/2019, 15:21 - Will Green: ya
04/04/2019, 15:21 - Greg: but apart from peas and sweetcorn youd be better off doing it fresh if youre making an actual dish
04/04/2019, 15:21 - Greg: so its ehh
04/04/2019, 15:21 - Will Green: how do you cook sweet potatoes well?
04/04/2019, 15:21 - Will Green: in a pan?
04/04/2019, 15:21 - Will Green: diced up
04/04/2019, 15:22 - Greg: just to mix in?
04/04/2019, 15:22 - Greg: depends how you want them really
04/04/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: to have them on the side
04/04/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: with a steak or something
04/04/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: lil bit crispy
04/04/2019, 15:23 - Greg: oh right
04/04/2019, 15:23 - Greg: nah and easier way of doing that is cut em into chip shape or whatever you want
04/04/2019, 15:23 - Greg: microwave them and drain the water
04/04/2019, 15:23 - Greg: cover in oil and salt/pepper
04/04/2019, 15:23 - Greg: stick em in the oven
04/04/2019, 15:23 - Greg: then you can do the steak while theyre crisping up
04/04/2019, 15:24 - Greg: *you dont have to microwave but it makes them cook so much faster
04/04/2019, 15:24 - Greg: and makes em more fluffy inside
04/04/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: dope
04/04/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: sounds great
04/04/2019, 15:25 - Will Green: will try that tomorrow
04/04/2019, 15:25 - Greg: pat em dry with some kitchen roll or something before you oil them
04/04/2019, 15:25 - Greg: and oil and season them in a bowl
04/04/2019, 15:25 - Greg: so they get covered and you dont use up loads of oil
04/04/2019, 15:25 - Greg: and dont use coconut oil
04/04/2019, 15:26 - Will Green: kk
04/04/2019, 15:27 - Greg: or if youre feeling extra fancy
04/04/2019, 15:27 - Greg: get yourself a stick of unsalted butter
04/04/2019, 15:27 - Greg: and use that
04/04/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: Should I get a brush for oiling shit
04/04/2019, 15:29 - Greg: you dont need it for oiling everyday stuff
04/04/2019, 15:30 - Greg: it couldnt hurt to have one if youre doing something with pastry
04/04/2019, 15:30 - Greg: but i rarely use mine
04/04/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: Okay cool
04/04/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: Will skip that then
04/04/2019, 15:32 - Greg: and now that youve got a balcony
04/04/2019, 15:32 - Greg: you should start growing your own herbs
04/04/2019, 15:33 - Will Green: Lmao
04/04/2019, 15:33 - Will Green: h e r b s
04/04/2019, 15:33 - Greg: 'erb

04/04/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: I'm going to change my programming at the gym
04/04/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: Focus on compound lifts more
04/04/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: Eat more food

04/04/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: Like wut
04/04/2019, 15:36 - Greg: basil, parsley, mint, thyme, oregano, chives
04/04/2019, 15:36 - Greg: mint and chives are impossible to kill
04/04/2019, 15:36 - Greg: the rest require a bit of maintenance
04/04/2019, 15:36 - Greg: but you get that extra bonus of cooking for a girl and being all
04/04/2019, 15:37 - Greg: i just need to get some herbs
04/04/2019, 15:37 - Greg: from my PLANT
04/04/2019, 15:39 - Will Green: Hmmm

04/04/2019, 15:41 - Will Green: don't have anywhere for plants really
04/04/2019, 15:41 - Will Green: would need some pots
04/04/2019, 15:41 - Greg: ye
04/04/2019, 15:41 - Will Green: but they'd look a bit outta' place
04/04/2019, 15:41 - Greg: have you got a morrisons around you
04/04/2019, 15:41 - Will Green: mmm yeah, I think so
04/04/2019, 15:41 - Greg: they sell off their excess plant pots here at least
04/04/2019, 15:42 - Greg: you can get 9 decent sized ones for 99 p
04/04/2019, 15:42 - Greg: its gr8
04/04/2019, 15:42 - Greg: and you can just get the shop herbs that are already grown
04/04/2019, 15:42 - Greg: and put them into good sized pots
04/04/2019, 15:45 - Will Green: hmmm
04/04/2019, 15:45 - Will Green: i shall enquire
04/04/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: there's an ikea round the corner from our place
04/04/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: which is really fucking convenient

04/04/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: mix
04/04/2019, 15:47 - Greg: i sorta feel like real plants that you cant eat are pretty poinltess
04/04/2019, 15:47 - Greg: pointless
04/04/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: depends
04/04/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: I think it's nice to have one or two to look after
04/04/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: but anything more than that is just annoying
04/04/2019, 15:48 - Greg: but you can just replace them with something you can eat
04/04/2019, 15:48 - Greg: then it has a purpose
04/04/2019, 15:48 - Will Green: to be eaten...
04/04/2019, 15:48 - Will Green: what an existence

08/04/2019, 17:02 - Greg: and sit on a spinny chair
08/04/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: they can all bid for me
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Greg: turn towards each as they talk
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Will Green: or maybe i'll get a chicken, cut its head off and then let it run on a twister board
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Will Green: and whatever colour it lands on
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Greg: and they have the option of activating the brake built into the chair
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Will Green: equates to a company
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Greg: if they want more time with you
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Greg: but it costs them money
08/04/2019, 17:03 - Greg: per newton of force applied to the brake
08/04/2019, 17:04 - Will Green: ofc
08/04/2019, 17:04 - Greg: nice
08/04/2019, 17:04 - Greg: maybe a combined
08/04/2019, 17:04 - Greg: you can put the chair on the chicken
08/04/2019, 17:04 - Will Green: they'll probably all just feather their breaks

08/04/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: who wasn't scaled with his aspect ratio locked
08/04/2019, 17:08 - Greg: exactly

Complete Greens™, via its kelp content, contains 15-25μg iodine per serving, making it the perfect amount; the rest you will likely consume in your daily diet, primarily from dairy sources.

12/04/2019, 19:08 - Will Green: Do you fry them with water?
12/04/2019, 19:09 - Will Green: Aren't you meant to hydrate them a bit?
12/04/2019, 19:09 - Will Green: I thought frying them would make them super dry
12/04/2019, 19:09 - Greg: what

12/04/2019, 19:09 - Greg: also you don't dry fry them

13/04/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: It's all pretty much the same
13/04/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: Just make sure it's a whey isolate

13/04/2019, 10:50 - Will Green: Optimum nutrition is the best for that I think

13/04/2019, 10:51 - Will Green: I've also heard recently that it's good to mix whey, casein and vegan protein
13/04/2019, 10:51 - Will Green: Whey can fuck up your stomach if you have loads

13/04/2019, 21:37 - Will Green: I think potentially
13/04/2019, 21:37 - Will Green: I asked her to send a picture of her with something in it to prove she wasn't catfishing
13/04/2019, 21:38 - Will Green: And it took a few messages after that before she blocked me
13/04/2019, 21:38 - Will Green: So I think it's highly likely that was the caeeb

14/04/2019, 18:54 - Will Green: which is fine if you just fill it with water and shake it out
14/04/2019, 18:54 - Greg: and a ball
14/04/2019, 18:54 - Will Green: no ball
14/04/2019, 18:55 - Will Green: you don't need a ball if the lid has a filter
14/04/2019, 18:55 - Greg: what if i *like* the cunks

14/04/2019, 19:09 - Will Green: and they aren't as big
14/04/2019, 19:09 - Will Green: so it encourages you to mix it with less wate

14/04/2019, 21:14 - Greg: its just there to subtly increase the depth of flavour
14/04/2019, 21:14 - Will Green: Sounds like exactly what I look for in seasoning
14/04/2019, 21:14 - Greg: its like putting salt on stuff

15/04/2019, 12:35 - Will Green: which I didn't think was possible
15/04/2019, 12:35 - Will Green: because my expectations were already so low...

17/04/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: isn't it great
17/04/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: when you buy a product
17/04/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: and then have to spend loads of time making that product work for you
17/04/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: rather than just buying a product
17/04/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: that solves problems for you
17/04/2019, 11:19 - Will Green: instead of creating them
17/04/2019, 11:19 - Will Green: 🍆💦🍎
17/04/2019, 11:19 - Greg: but making things difficult for myself is the fun part

17/04/2019, 11:20 - Greg: i either use my googlebucks or download them

17/04/2019, 11:38 - Will Green: buying a phone
17/04/2019, 11:39 - Will Green: and then having to spend loads of time customising it so that its interface is good
17/04/2019, 11:50 - Will Green: Would it be weird making a chilli with ground turkey?
17/04/2019, 11:52 - Greg: oh I mean the stock launcher is fine
17/04/2019, 11:52 - Greg: has icons you press to launch apps
17/04/2019, 11:53 - Greg: i mean you could I guess
17/04/2019, 11:53 - Greg: or you could use it to make a more flavour friendly dish
17/04/2019, 11:53 - Will Green: great design
17/04/2019, 11:54 - Greg: ive thought of a thing we can make
17/04/2019, 11:55 - Greg: do you like mushrooms
17/04/2019, 11:55 - Will Green: nah but tbh I haven't tried them in a long time

17/04/2019, 11:55 - Will Green: but haven't tried them for years
17/04/2019, 11:55 - Will Green: what is it?
17/04/2019, 12:04 - Greg: it's probably got an actual name
17/04/2019, 12:04 - Greg: something French
17/04/2019, 12:06 - Will Green: Baguettes?
17/04/2019, 12:06 - Greg: but it's basically chicken breasts in a white wine and mushroom sauce
17/04/2019, 12:06 - Greg: oh sorry yes baguettes

17/04/2019, 17:01 - Greg: Is it even possible to hit that without actively trying
17/04/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: Nope
17/04/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: I'm on 150g of protein a day
17/04/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: And that's fairly low
17/04/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: I told you, nobody consumes as much protein as they should
17/04/2019, 17:03 - Will Green: For building muscle
17/04/2019, 17:03 - Will Green: It's like the number one reason why people who go to the gym don't get bigger
17/04/2019, 17:04 - Greg: Okay so I know what I'm having for dinner
17/04/2019, 17:04 - Greg: So I wonder how much more I'll need
17/04/2019, 17:05 - Will Green: What have you eaten today?
17/04/2019, 17:05 - Will Green: You need beans, nuts, meat, milk, whey
17/04/2019, 17:05 - Will Green: A combination of them all can just about get me to my target daily
17/04/2019, 17:05 - Will Green: Oh, and protein bars help

17/04/2019, 17:43 - Will Green: to go and squat
17/04/2019, 17:44 - Will Green: with a smith machine
17/04/2019, 17:44 - Will Green: it's probably not even worth it
17/04/2019, 17:44 - Greg: kek
17/04/2019, 17:44 - Greg: sure
17/04/2019, 17:44 - Greg: and you can squat with some air too

17/04/2019, 17:50 - Will Green: I bet I'll be able to squat like 150kg on a Smith machine
17/04/2019, 17:51 - Will Green: I'm actually interested to see how my Smith squat differs to normal squat
17/04/2019, 17:51 - Will Green: I bet the difference is insane
17/04/2019, 18:03 - Greg: i bet youll do 1.68x the weight
17/04/2019, 18:29 - Will Green: Did you Google that
17/04/2019, 18:29 - Will Green: Isn't it great when you don't need stabilisers
17/04/2019, 18:29 - Will Green: If only there was one plane in real life

17/04/2019, 18:39 - Greg: its like
17/04/2019, 18:40 - Greg: 10x the joint stress of a regular pullup
17/04/2019, 18:40 - Greg: with .3x of the muscle usage
17/04/2019, 18:41 - Greg: it would be like i span round in a circle to do lat raises
17/04/2019, 18:44 - Will Green: Like a top
17/04/2019, 18:48 - Greg: <Media omitted>
17/04/2019, 18:48 - Greg: you should get this to go with your new muscles

17/04/2019, 19:08 - Will Green: Christ it's awful

17/04/2019, 19:09 - Will Green: Just get a well fitted t-shirt
17/04/2019, 19:09 - Will Green: Not some weird wetsuit like cling on
17/04/2019, 19:09 - Greg: Its good at letting you know who is a collosal wanker
17/04/2019, 19:09 - Will Green: True

17/04/2019, 20:20 - Will Green: What can I add to tuna and rice to make it interesting?
17/04/2019, 20:32 - Greg: chicken
17/04/2019, 20:32 - Greg: minus the tuna
17/04/2019, 20:33 - Greg: something lemony usually goes well with fish
17/04/2019, 20:33 - Greg: tinned tuna is difficult to season though
17/04/2019, 20:33 - Greg: it's like trying to season precooked chicken slices
17/04/2019, 20:35 - Greg: the best you can really do probably is season the rice well
17/04/2019, 20:35 - Greg: and add in some nice veg

22/04/2019, 09:46 - Will Green: Was like a day in the life thing
22/04/2019, 09:47 - Greg: You show me a lot of ripped men on youtube
22/04/2019, 09:47 - Will Green: And he had a black coffee and some 5htp

22/04/2019, 09:47 - Will Green: And you repeated it
22/04/2019, 09:47 - Will Green: In disgust
22/04/2019, 09:47 - Will Green: God your memory is awful
22/04/2019, 09:47 - Greg: See I can imagine being disgusted by those words
22/04/2019, 09:47 - Greg: But I don't remember him saying them
22/04/2019, 09:48 - Greg: You're right
22/04/2019, 09:48 - Greg: I should watch more muscle men in youtube
22/04/2019, 09:48 - Greg: So it sticks in my brain
22/04/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: Yes
22/04/2019, 09:49 - Greg: Like muscle glue
22/04/2019, 09:49 - Will Green: Exactly like muscle glue
22/04/2019, 09:50 - Greg: <Media omitted>
22/04/2019, 09:50 - Greg: This is be me
22/04/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: it looks a lot like you
22/04/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: if your face was inflated
22/04/2019, 10:10 - Greg: I always knew I wasn't white
22/04/2019, 10:10 - Will Green: has this only just occurred to you?
22/04/2019, 10:11 - Greg: See I just realise that I have 2 ears
22/04/2019, 10:13 - Will Green: and they're both really, really small
22/04/2019, 10:13 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
22/04/2019, 10:14 - Greg: I wonder if he ate so much that his fat squished around them
22/04/2019, 10:14 - Greg: Can you get fat ewes
22/04/2019, 10:14 - Greg: Ears
22/04/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: no
22/04/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: they're cartilage
22/04/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: unfortunately
22/04/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: imagine how lean my ears would be
22/04/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: maybe they'd have abs
22/04/2019, 10:15 - Greg: What about the flappy bits
22/04/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: fat ear lobes?
22/04/2019, 10:16 - Greg: Yeh
22/04/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: a quick google says no
22/04/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: and also it's clear that many people get tunnels
22/04/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: and they destory their ear lobes
22/04/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: what a stupid craze that was
22/04/2019, 10:20 - Greg: gotta stretch out those lobes
22/04/2019, 10:20 - Greg: imagine if youd done that as a teenage
22/04/2019, 10:20 - Greg: id be regretting it every day
22/04/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: it would probably be the biggest source of insecurity for me
22/04/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: which is saying something
22/04/2019, 10:23 - Greg: Just cut them off at that point
22/04/2019, 10:23 - Greg: Get some fake lobes you have to put in every day
22/04/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: like ear rings
22/04/2019, 10:23 - Greg: But then you're at risk of your lobes detaching at unfortunate times
22/04/2019, 10:24 - Will Green: but without the rings
22/04/2019, 10:24 - Will Green: your ear lobes may fall out when you're at your big interview
22/04/2019, 10:25 - Will Green: with your ocular pat-down glasses
22/04/2019, 10:25 - Will Green: at least they wouldn't be able to see your tears
22/04/2019, 10:27 - Greg: what it my ocular pat down glasses fill with tears
22/04/2019, 10:27 - Greg: and it's like I'm looking at them underwater
22/04/2019, 10:28 - Will Green: then you'll be really hydrated
22/04/2019, 10:28 - Will Green: epic win

22/04/2019, 10:30 - Greg: It's not too bad though
22/04/2019, 10:30 - Greg: The sub is basically just people posting weight loss pictures
22/04/2019, 10:30 - Greg: It's not like the NoFap one where they all have superpowers

22/04/2019, 10:37 - Greg: Oh yeah and he was meditating
22/04/2019, 10:38 - Greg: You could tell he was meditating because he was in the meditation pose
22/04/2019, 10:38 - Greg: That's the only form of limb arrangement you can initialise medititation in
22/04/2019, 10:39 - Will Green: Especially with bone broth
22/04/2019, 10:39 - Will Green: Yeah
22/04/2019, 10:39 - Will Green: You have to be sat above the floor too
22/04/2019, 10:39 - Will Green: Elevation is the key

22/04/2019, 10:42 - Will Green: 10kg
22/04/2019, 10:42 - Greg: Maybe that's just a tiny woman
22/04/2019, 10:43 - Greg: Or tiny man with a womanly frame
22/04/2019, 10:43 - Will Green: I'm going to cut again in two weeks

24/04/2019, 22:05 - Will Green: it's embedded in me, ey?
24/04/2019, 22:05 - Will Green: I'm going to be taking home over 4k a month after tax
24/04/2019, 22:05 - Will Green: what the fuck do you even do with that
24/04/2019, 22:05 - Greg: oy*
24/04/2019, 22:06 - Greg: i think you should take it out the bank as fivers and burn it in front of poor people
24/04/2019, 22:07 - Will Green: god
24/04/2019, 22:07 - Will Green: I genuinely let out some weird evil laugh then

24/04/2019, 22:14 - Greg: im sure that doesnt reflect on you though
24/04/2019, 22:17 - Will Green: oh god
24/04/2019, 22:17 - Will Green: I think if anything it'll make that more difficult
24/04/2019, 22:19 - Greg: thats true actually
24/04/2019, 22:19 - Greg: theyll just see a man with a big bank and low body fat
24/04/2019, 22:19 - Greg: no one will actually love you for who you are
24/04/2019, 22:31 - Will Green: Lmao
24/04/2019, 22:31 - Will Green: Maybe my bodyfat will increase
24/04/2019, 22:31 - Will Green: With the money
24/04/2019, 22:32 - Greg: yeah
24/04/2019, 22:32 - Greg: youll stuff it under your skin once you start not trusting banks

25/04/2019, 10:48 - Will Green: Wow
25/04/2019, 10:48 - Will Green: Is everyone autistic?
25/04/2019, 10:49 - Greg: they must be right
25/04/2019, 10:49 - Greg: i dont understand how people cant be
25/04/2019, 10:50 - Greg: one of the key signs of autism from the nhs
25/04/2019, 10:50 - Greg: >repetitive behaviour, routines and activities – such as fixed daily routines and repetitive body movements
25/04/2019, 10:50 - Greg: does that mean every single person that goes to the gym is heavily autistic
25/04/2019, 10:50 - Will Green: Yeah
25/04/2019, 10:50 - Will Green: Must do
25/04/2019, 10:51 - Greg: fuck
25/04/2019, 10:51 - Greg: /fit/ told me that lifting cures autism
25/04/2019, 10:51 - Will Green: Bamboozled again
25/04/2019, 10:51 - Will Green: God

25/04/2019, 10:52 - Will Green: Quitting is horrible
25/04/2019, 10:52 - Greg: fashion it into a paper plane and throw it at him
25/04/2019, 10:52 - Greg: right at the end of the day
25/04/2019, 10:52 - Greg: so you can run as it flys
25/04/2019, 10:52 - Will Green: Hit him in the eye
25/04/2019, 10:52 - Will Green: Blind him

25/04/2019, 11:30 - Will Green: or i'll miss out on a load of mullar
25/04/2019, 11:30 - Greg: i suppose that sweet smell of metallic wealth is too much for a schnozz as so included as yours
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Greg: fuck
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Greg: as so inclined
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Will Green: nice
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Will Green: can't believe I just told the PM
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Will Green: and his response was
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Will Green: yeah i'm leaving too
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Will Green: lmfao
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Will Green: he wasn't even the one I thought was going to leave
25/04/2019, 11:31 - Greg: maybe everyones leaving will
25/04/2019, 11:32 - Will Green: god they are going to be so fucked
25/04/2019, 11:32 - Will Green: PM and PD leave from the same team
25/04/2019, 11:32 - Greg: theres going to be a line at the end of the day
25/04/2019, 11:32 - Will Green: the engineers won't have a fucking clue what to do
25/04/2019, 11:32 - Will Green: until they hire two other people
25/04/2019, 11:32 - Greg: with people holding their notices
25/04/2019, 11:32 - Will Green: haha
25/04/2019, 11:34 - Greg: i cant wait to see how this turns out
25/04/2019, 11:34 - Greg: its like a shitty daytime soap centered around a startup thats an average place to work
25/04/2019, 11:36 - Will Green: yeah
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Will Green: i'm really not looking forward to telling him
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Will Green: I feel like it's not going to go down well at all
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Greg: can you wear a gopro when you hand it in
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Will Green: I don't understand how he doesn't see it coming
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Will Green: so naice
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Will Green: naive*
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Will Green: hahahahaha
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Greg: who is the product manager
25/04/2019, 11:37 - Greg: is that grants boss
25/04/2019, 11:38 - Will Green: nah
25/04/2019, 11:38 - Will Green: he's basically my boss on my team
25/04/2019, 11:38 - Will Green: we have crossfunctional teams for each product
25/04/2019, 11:38 - Will Green: and one of those teams is one designer, one PM and a bunch of engineers
25/04/2019, 11:38 - Will Green: designers report to grant
25/04/2019, 11:38 - Will Green: and PMs report to the head of product
25/04/2019, 11:39 - Will Green: but I get my work from the PM on my team
25/04/2019, 11:39 - Will Green: so the designer and PM on one of the 3 teams are leaving basically at the same time
25/04/2019, 11:39 - Will Green: so one team will literally just be some engineers soon
25/04/2019, 11:39 - Will Green: which will be a fucking disaster
25/04/2019, 11:41 - Greg: oh no
25/04/2019, 11:41 - Greg: that hilarious
25/04/2019, 11:41 - Greg: more like "dis" amirite
25/04/2019, 11:42 - Greg: i wonder if im going to see some more beamery ads pop up soon
25/04/2019, 11:42 - Will Green: yes
25/04/2019, 11:42 - Will Green: i suspect you will
25/04/2019, 11:43 - Greg: also ive finally removed the final rest from my floor leg raises
25/04/2019, 11:43 - Greg: literally just a single set of 120 now
25/04/2019, 11:43 - Greg: i can fold like paper
25/04/2019, 11:43 - Greg: the next step is figuring out how to make them heavier
25/04/2019, 11:43 - Greg: so i dont have to do 120
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: hahahaha
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: 120?!?!
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: no way can you do 120 leg raises in one set
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: I do not believe that for a minute
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Greg: just did it broski
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: you're definitely doing them wrong
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: do some this weekend
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: and i'll correct your form
25/04/2019, 11:44 - Will Green: I bet you flail around like a fish
25/04/2019, 11:45 - Greg: <Media omitted>
25/04/2019, 11:45 - Greg: im doing this
25/04/2019, 11:45 - Greg: minus the bench
25/04/2019, 11:46 - Will Green: https://www.crowdcube.com/companies/freetrade/pitches/lzLEpb
25/04/2019, 11:46 - Will Green: are your glutes coming up off the ground at the top?
25/04/2019, 11:46 - Will Green: are your legs perfectly straight
25/04/2019, 11:46 - Will Green: are you controlling the movement on the way down?
25/04/2019, 11:46 - Will Green: your legs should come down super slow
25/04/2019, 11:46 - Greg: yes
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Greg: mostly
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Greg: no
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Will Green: and they shouldn't touch the ground when you bring them down
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Greg: im whizzing them down
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Will Green: that's the problem
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Greg: and catching them before they hit the ground
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Greg: so its faster
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Will Green: it's all about the ecentric
25/04/2019, 11:47 - Greg: i tried googling that
25/04/2019, 11:48 - Greg: google thinks its not a real word
25/04/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: i spelt it wrong
25/04/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: eccentric
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Will Green: wait
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Will Green: no
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Greg: oh see thats what i thought it might be
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Greg: but it still didnt make sense to me
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Will Green: yeah, that's right
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Will Green: that's how you spell it
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Greg: to be keen and kooky?
25/04/2019, 11:50 - Will Green: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_training
25/04/2019, 11:52 - Will Green: huh
25/04/2019, 11:52 - Greg: <Media omitted>
25/04/2019, 11:53 - Will Green: look at the link I sent
25/04/2019, 11:56 - Greg: oof
25/04/2019, 11:56 - Greg: so the down is just as important as the up
25/04/2019, 11:56 - Greg: i noticed that with curls
25/04/2019, 11:56 - Greg: get them burny forearms on the way down
25/04/2019, 12:57 - Will Green: the down is more important than the up
25/04/2019, 12:57 - Will Green: in almost every movement you do
25/04/2019, 12:57 - Will Green: don't let the weight fall
25/04/2019, 12:57 - Will Green: control its decent
25/04/2019, 12:58 - Greg: i do like my control to be good and proper
25/04/2019, 12:58 - Greg: yeah i do with weights
25/04/2019, 12:58 - Greg: i just dont with bodyweight
25/04/2019, 12:58 - Greg: oops
25/04/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: it's especially important for leg raises
25/04/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: I could do leg raises forever if I let my legs fall down
25/04/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: you'll spend less time exercising too
25/04/2019, 12:59 - Greg: id like to see that
25/04/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: because intensity will go up
25/04/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: so you won't have to do 120 reps
25/04/2019, 13:00 - Greg: hmm
25/04/2019, 13:01 - Greg: whats the increase in intensity to reduction in reps ratio
25/04/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: depends what you want to do
25/04/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: higher rep ranges at a lower intensity are good for building muscle
25/04/2019, 13:01 - Greg: a e s t h e t i c s
25/04/2019, 13:01 - Will Green: but lower rep ranges and higher intensity are good for building strength
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: so a e s t h e t i c s = low weight, high reps
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: but 120 leg raises is ridiculous
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: you're just not doing them right
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Greg: stop shaming me
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: just do more hanging leg raises
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: they're more intense
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: but you should also not be letting your legs fall down on a leg raise
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Greg: ye
25/04/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: or knee raise
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Greg: im just doing knee raises
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Will Green: we can go to the gym in my building on Friday maybe
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Greg: i havent got the height for leg
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Will Green: and I'll show you properly how to do knee raises
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Greg: i cant hold myself up high enough for that long
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Will Green: yeah
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Greg: i just dangle n knee
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Will Green: that's annoying
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Greg: i extend slightly as i go up
25/04/2019, 13:03 - Greg: its a weird hybrid
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Greg: ye
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Greg: show me your movements william
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Will Green: yeah that's not great
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Greg: and i will copy
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Will Green: ideally you need your legs to be straight
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Will Green: do you not have somewhere outside?
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Will Green: where you can do that
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Greg: what
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Greg: like
25/04/2019, 13:04 - Greg: an outdoor doorframe?
25/04/2019, 13:05 - Greg: thats higher than an average doorframe?
25/04/2019, 13:05 - Will Green: Yeah
25/04/2019, 13:05 - Will Green: For outdoor people
25/04/2019, 13:05 - Will Green: Giants and such
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Greg: hmmm
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Greg: ill have a look around
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Will Green: No, like a tree or maybe a shed that you could mount it to
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Greg: but im not convinced
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Greg: maybe ill go to the local childs playground
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Will Green: Or you could get some rope around branches of a tree
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Will Green: And do it with Olympic rings
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Will Green: Or a trx
25/04/2019, 13:06 - Will Green: But you're white
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Greg: i think
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Greg: im just going to carry on doing knee raises
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Greg: and do more of them
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Greg: only on the very outside
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Will Green: God my shits are so dense these days
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Will Green: But you need to be able to do them properly
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Will Green: Same as leg raises
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Will Green: Or you're waiting your time
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Greg: wat
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Greg: i can do knee raises fine
25/04/2019, 13:07 - Greg: just not leg raises
25/04/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: No, you need to hang with your legs straight
25/04/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: Hang straight then lift your legs up and touch your knees to your chest
25/04/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: Full range of motion

10/05/2019, 15:05 - Will Green: maybe just try myprotein
10/05/2019, 15:05 - Will Green: think they're the cheapest
10/05/2019, 15:05 - Greg: BULK POWDERS is even cheaper
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: eh
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: it's just as expensive
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: https://www.myprotein.com/sports-nutrition/impact-whey-isolate/10530911.html
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: £100 for 5kg
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: you want isolate
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Greg: not on amazon
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: oh shit
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Greg: uhhh
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: get bulk powders then
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Greg: i see
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: check the content though
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Greg: will it be obvious
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Greg: if its isolate
10/05/2019, 15:06 - Will Green: just check the content
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: it should be like 25g of protein for 130 cals or something
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: just compare the ON one against it
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Greg: myprotein
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Greg: 20g 100 calories
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Greg: thats basically the same
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: seems about right
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: is that diet whey or isolate?
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: it'll say in the title
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Greg: BULK
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Greg: 24g protein
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: ah
10/05/2019, 15:07 - Greg: 122 cal
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: about the same
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: if you go for myprotein, just make sure you don't get 'diet whey\
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: cause they put a bunch of other shit in it
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Greg: oh i dont think the myprotein one is isolate
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: like green tea extract
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: and CLA
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Greg: it doesnt say it anywhere obvious
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: you don't want that shit
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: link
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Greg: https://www.amazon.co.uk/MY-PROTEIN-10530997-Protein-Chocolate/dp/B00CHJ470G/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=whey+myprotein&qid=1557497125&s=drugstore&sr=1-3
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Greg: oh
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Greg: i just scrolled down
10/05/2019, 15:08 - Greg: and found the isolate one
10/05/2019, 15:10 - Greg: https://www.amazon.co.uk/BULK-POWDERS-Protein-Isolate-Unflavoured/dp/B00SP30UI6/
10/05/2019, 15:10 - Greg: whys that so much cheaper
10/05/2019, 15:14 - Will Green: which one?
10/05/2019, 15:14 - Will Green: BP?
10/05/2019, 15:14 - Greg: ye
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Will Green: idk
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Will Green: i think that myprotein one is a really old listing or something
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Will Green: it has their old branding
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Will Green: and most of it is out of stock
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Will Green: seems weird
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Will Green: just go for BP
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Greg: its still 27 quid on their website though
10/05/2019, 15:15 - Greg: ye

10/05/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: just buy two 2.5kg then
10/05/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: it's probably something to do with Amazon's automated pricing based on demand
10/05/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: have a look on camelcamelcamel
10/05/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: see if has fluctuated

10/05/2019, 15:20 - Greg: its all over the place
10/05/2019, 15:20 - Greg: <Media omitted>

10/05/2019, 15:22 - Greg: shit
10/05/2019, 15:22 - Greg: this is only the 90
10/05/2019, 15:23 - Greg: my poor gains
10/05/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: more expensive though
10/05/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: £120 for 5kg
10/05/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: vs £100 for 90
10/05/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: why's it so cheap on Amazon?
10/05/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: it's way more expensive on their own website
10/05/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: I mean
10/05/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: whey more expensive
10/05/2019, 15:25 - Greg: ayyy
10/05/2019, 15:25 - Greg: i have no idea
10/05/2019, 15:25 - Greg: maybe theyve gotta compete more with other ones on amazon?
10/05/2019, 15:25 - Greg: not a clue
10/05/2019, 15:26 - Will Green: am I being an idiot
10/05/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: there's more protein per calorie in BP
10/05/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: by quite a significant margin
10/05/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: WTF
10/05/2019, 15:27 - Greg: yup
10/05/2019, 15:27 - Greg: looks like it
10/05/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: Fuck.
10/05/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: I've been jipped
10/05/2019, 15:28 - Greg: even per calorie BP is better
10/05/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: I don't think it tastes as good
10/05/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: from what I can remember
10/05/2019, 15:28 - Greg: who cares
10/05/2019, 15:28 - Greg: getting huge isnt about enjoying food
10/05/2019, 15:29 - Greg: its about shoveling in the necessary biomass to get H U G E
10/05/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: it's about eating chicken and rice
10/05/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: plane chicken and rice
10/05/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: right, well I need to finish my 5kg sack of ON whey
10/05/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: so I can switch to the good stuff...
10/05/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: that's well annoying
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: I bet I won't finish it for ages
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Greg: >plane chicken
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Greg: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Greg: i thought you had bulk powder stuff
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: hahahaha
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Greg: ive seen that logo somewhere
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: wtf is that
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: why did you have that on hand?
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: I get my creatine from them
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: and greens
10/05/2019, 15:30 - Will Green: and collagen
10/05/2019, 15:31 - Will Green: whey is from ON
10/05/2019, 15:31 - Will Green: I think ON add BCAAs
10/05/2019, 15:31 - Will Green: but turns out they're bullshit anyway
10/05/2019, 15:33 - Greg: i have an entire directory of <Transport>/Unikonta/Obazoa/Opisthokont/Holozoa/Filozoa/Animalia/Chordata/Aves/Galliformes/Phasianidae/Gallus/G.gallus/G. g. domesticus
10/05/2019, 15:33 - Greg: that was so worth copying off wikipedia
10/05/2019, 15:33 - Will Green: nice
10/05/2019, 15:33 - Greg: what is a BCAA
10/05/2019, 15:33 - Greg: is that like a banana
10/05/2019, 15:34 - Will Green: it's what you find in bananas
10/05/2019, 15:34 - Greg: what actually are they
10/05/2019, 15:35 - Greg: do they do anything
10/05/2019, 15:35 - Greg: or is it just for people on the edge
10/05/2019, 15:35 - Greg: spending 20 hours in the gym a day
10/05/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: branch chain amino acids
10/05/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: nah
10/05/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: all protein contains BCAAs
10/05/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: BCAA is just another layer of extraction on whey
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Will Green: so it's basically pure
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Will Green: and has like 10 calories
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Will Green: so people thought it was really good for cutting
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Will Green: cause you could get all the protein you needed without consuming any calories
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Will Green: but it turns out they're bullshit
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Will Green: because you still need other amino acids on top of BCAAs to build muscle
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Greg: im shocked
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Greg: a fitness fact was proven to be shit
10/05/2019, 15:36 - Will Green: so basically, if you really want to cut you can just take EAAs (essential amino acids)
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Greg: i have no idea what anything is anymore
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Will Green: EAAs are almost the same, but they have other amino acids and slightly more calories
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Greg: i thought cutting just meant eating less
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Will Green: yes and no
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Will Green: when you're on a cut you want to maintain your muscle mass
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Will Green: while losing body fat
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Will Green: so eating less, but not too little
10/05/2019, 15:37 - Will Green: and you still need to eat the same amount of protein
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: so you basically have to drop your carbs and fats, keep your protein the same
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: that's why people liked the idea of BCAAs
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: because it meant that they could eat more carbs and fats
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Greg: cant you just eat less carbs and fat
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: while still maintaining a caloric deficit
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: if that makes sense
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Greg: and keep your normal protein
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: yes
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: absolutely
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: that's 100% what you should do
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: but people wanna eat more while cutting
10/05/2019, 15:38 - Will Green: if that means paying £40 for some powder
10/05/2019, 15:39 - Greg: i guess compared to the roids its nothing
10/05/2019, 15:39 - Will Green: yeah
10/05/2019, 15:39 - Will Green: people take EAAs intra-workout because they digest really quickly
10/05/2019, 15:39 - Will Green: and they're good to take when fasting
10/05/2019, 15:39 - Will Green: cause they don't spike your insulin
10/05/2019, 15:39 - Will Green: so you can maintain muscle
10/05/2019, 15:39 - Will Green: while burning fat
10/05/2019, 15:40 - Will Green: that's the idea
10/05/2019, 15:40 - Will Green: but ultimately the best thing to do is just make sure you're eating the right macros
10/05/2019, 15:40 - Will Green: whey is still the king
10/05/2019, 15:40 - Will Green: 🤴king whey
10/05/2019, 15:40 - Greg: why is there no powder emoji
10/05/2019, 15:42 - Will Green: we need a whey emoji
10/05/2019, 15:42 - Will Green: let's tweet tim apple
10/05/2019, 15:43 - Greg: 🐮❌♨🧂
10/05/2019, 15:43 - Greg: i cant believe you got cucked by ON
10/05/2019, 15:44 - Greg: youre going to be so embarssed once i overtake you from my extra protein
10/05/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: ikr
10/05/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: in two months you'll be bigger than me
10/05/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: your damn linear gains
10/05/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: marginally steeper than mine
10/05/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: will overtake me in a matter of weeks
10/05/2019, 15:45 - Greg: imagine it
10/05/2019, 15:45 - Greg: i could do linear gains
10/05/2019, 15:45 - Greg: and if my x is days
10/05/2019, 15:45 - Will Green: https://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/high-protein-snack-bars-box-of-12.html damn son
10/05/2019, 15:45 - Will Green: 27g per bar
10/05/2019, 15:45 - Greg: by month 3 i can go from benching a 1kg dumbell to a 90kg dumbell
10/05/2019, 15:46 - Greg: i think you mean
10/05/2019, 15:46 - Greg: HUGE 27g per bar
10/05/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: oh yeah sorry
10/05/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: HUGE 27g
10/05/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: as opposed to a regular 27g
10/05/2019, 15:49 - Will Green: that BP says 'Unrivalled 23g BCAA per 100g'
10/05/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: I don't understand what that means
10/05/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: ohhhh
10/05/2019, 15:50 - Will Green: per 100g
10/05/2019, 15:50 - Greg: for every 23g of BCAA it packs in 100g of BCAAs
10/05/2019, 15:51 - Will Green: fuck
10/05/2019, 15:51 - Will Green: i wish i'd got this
10/05/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: to hit 30g I need to have like 1.25 scoops of ON
10/05/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: which is like
10/05/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: 200 calories

14/05/2019, 22:23 - Greg: Maybe slightly less keen to mix itself?
14/05/2019, 22:23 - Greg: But that's not really an issue
14/05/2019, 22:23 - Greg: Since the muscle it provides will contribute to more severe mix ability
14/05/2019, 22:24 - Will Green: It's a vicious circle

15/05/2019, 14:35 - Will Green: I have a little project for you
15/05/2019, 14:35 - Will Green: that I think you'll enjoy
15/05/2019, 15:26 - Greg: Fugg
15/05/2019, 15:26 - Greg: What you got for me
15/05/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: basically I want to automatically populate a field in an excel spreadsheat with my weight every day
15/05/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: and also auto-populate a different field with my calorie intake everyday
15/05/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: both come from myfitnesspal, which has an API
15/05/2019, 16:23 - Greg: send me ya spreadsheet
15/05/2019, 16:24 - Will Green: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1alSqOSNVZSr4RibfJ_tkT9BGmuu2luvENnAbR4Zlh5c/edit?usp=sharing
15/05/2019, 16:25 - Will Green: just given you view access for now
15/05/2019, 16:25 - Will Green: but can give you edit rights if you need them
15/05/2019, 16:41 - Greg: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python
15/05/2019, 16:41 - Greg: click enable the google sheets api
15/05/2019, 16:41 - Greg: and send me the client config
15/05/2019, 16:43 - Greg: the json file
15/05/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
15/05/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: I hope this doesn't give you access to all of my sheets
15/05/2019, 16:44 - Greg: it doesnt sadly
15/05/2019, 16:44 - Greg: i have to specify the sheet ID
15/05/2019, 16:44 - Greg: i cant just browse
15/05/2019, 16:44 - Will Green: to clarify - at the end of each day when I mark my diary as complete in MFP, I want to import my weight and my calories for that day in to the associated cells for that day
15/05/2019, 16:45 - Will Green: I don't want it to do it retrospectively or anything
15/05/2019, 16:45 - Greg: yes massa of course massa juke and jive for ya massa
15/05/2019, 16:46 - Will Green: if this works, i think it would be a good app idea
15/05/2019, 16:46 - Will Green: because no other tracking app does this at the moment
15/05/2019, 16:46 - Will Green: and it's way more important than just tracking calories and weight seperately
15/05/2019, 16:47 - Greg: i love apps
15/05/2019, 16:47 - Greg: maybe it can be a wapp
15/05/2019, 16:47 - Will Green: wapp?

15/05/2019, 16:47 - Greg: like

15/05/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: wow
15/05/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: so that's why there's loads of these weird profiles appearing?
15/05/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: it's so strange
15/05/2019, 17:00 - Greg: Yup
15/05/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: Have you seen them too?
15/05/2019, 17:00 - Greg: I haven't got any yet
15/05/2019, 17:04 - Will Green: I just had to apply for API access for MFP
15/05/2019, 17:04 - Will Green: so this may be a no go
15/05/2019, 17:04 - Will Green: however
15/05/2019, 17:04 - Greg: Nah

15/05/2019, 17:07 - Greg: I do
15/05/2019, 17:07 - Greg: That's doable though
15/05/2019, 17:07 - Greg: You can use credentials in GETs
15/05/2019, 17:07 - Greg: Boom bam
15/05/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: I think I can make it public
15/05/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: one sec

15/05/2019, 17:10 - Greg: You can either run it manually
15/05/2019, 17:10 - Greg: Or it can do it by itself at midnight
15/05/2019, 17:10 - Will Green: the only thing you can't see on that is my weight
15/05/2019, 17:12 - Greg: do your scales have a website?

17/05/2019, 09:48 - Greg: Now you just need to factor in your thirst variable

17/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: if it's an easy lay, then i'll go for it
17/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: BUT

17/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: cause she's being really intense
17/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: clearly wants a relationship
17/05/2019, 09:49 - Will Green: so there's two thirst variables
17/05/2019, 09:49 - Will Green: that need to be factored in here

19/05/2019, 16:16 - Greg: <Media omitted>
19/05/2019, 16:17 - Greg: what does that even mean
19/05/2019, 16:17 - Greg: you do them once youve built satisfactory mass
19/05/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: Hahaha
19/05/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: As in like overall width and size
19/05/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: Preachers are for the peak
19/05/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: But I think they're still good anyway
19/05/2019, 16:18 - Greg: for the peak
19/05/2019, 16:18 - Greg: what does that mean
19/05/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: Better to do concentration curls
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: Than bad form standing curls
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: Where you cheat
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Greg: also when am i even going to build satisfactory mass
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Greg: muh dismoyphia
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: It means when you flex, the top round bit of the nice
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: Bicep*
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Greg: concentration curls are hard as fuck
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: Ya
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: Which is good
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Greg: ive really gotta concentrate
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: That's why arm blasters are great
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Greg: i thought targeted exercises were bad
19/05/2019, 16:19 - Greg: muh compound
19/05/2019, 16:21 - Greg: back down to 7.5
19/05/2019, 16:21 - Greg: ashamed my famiruu
19/05/2019, 16:21 - Greg: muss commit sodoku
19/05/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: Compounds are better Yeah
19/05/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: For overall muscle gain
19/05/2019, 16:23 - Will Green: But isolation is better for developing specific muscles
19/05/2019, 16:24 - Will Green: And just doing a nice curl with bad form doesn't make it compound
19/05/2019, 16:24 - Will Green: It just makes it a badly performed isolation exercise
19/05/2019, 16:25 - Greg: damnit
19/05/2019, 16:25 - Greg: well i guess like that big black man said
19/05/2019, 16:25 - Greg: everybody wanna be a bodybuilder but nobody wanna lift no heavy ass weight

19/05/2019, 18:11 - Will Green: That makes it easier
19/05/2019, 18:11 - Will Green: One click installs of different stacks

19/05/2019, 20:51 - Will Green: depends how much of a deficit you're in too
19/05/2019, 20:51 - Will Green: or surplus
19/05/2019, 20:52 - Greg: last i checked
19/05/2019, 20:52 - Greg: apparently like 600 calories
19/05/2019, 20:52 - Greg: but i havent weighed myself in a bit
19/05/2019, 20:52 - Will Green: lol
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Greg: maybe ive become fat
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Will Green: i think it also raises your cholestarol
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Will Green: so it damages circulation in high quantities basically
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Will Green: but i think it's basically fine as long as you're not eating chips every day of your life
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Greg: but whey lowers protein
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Greg: no
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Greg: cholesterol
19/05/2019, 20:53 - Greg: whey lowers chloesterol

20/05/2019, 09:42 - Greg: If they literally don't care what you're doing
20/05/2019, 09:42 - Greg: There's some more involved ones
20/05/2019, 09:42 - Greg: Try crank if that's the case
20/05/2019, 09:42 - Greg: That's good fun
20/05/2019, 09:42 - Greg: Or if you do need to be a little bit subtle
20/05/2019, 09:43 - Greg: There's loads where you just do some resource and production management every now and then
20/05/2019, 09:43 - Greg: Or I dunno how familiar you are with java script
20/05/2019, 09:43 - Greg: But bit burner is fun too
20/05/2019, 09:44 - Greg: But you write all your production in netscript
20/05/2019, 09:45 - Greg: The classic every now and then game is kittens though
20/05/2019, 09:45 - Greg: You can just tab out for like 10 minutes
20/05/2019, 09:45 - Greg: Get some resources
20/05/2019, 09:45 - Greg: Tab back in and buy some stuff
20/05/2019, 09:45 - Greg: Repeat
20/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: Interesting
20/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: I am currently enjoying browsing reddit though
20/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: And that seems to be a pretty good time sink
20/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: I'm currently cooking some oats
20/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: At work
20/05/2019, 09:48 - Will Green: As you do

20/05/2019, 09:49 - Greg: Of course
20/05/2019, 09:49 - Greg: But the great thing about idle games
20/05/2019, 09:49 - Will Green: Is that you can be idle?
20/05/2019, 09:49 - Greg: Is that you can play them while youre not thete
20/05/2019, 09:49 - Greg: Exactly
20/05/2019, 09:49 - Greg: You got it

20/05/2019, 09:52 - Will Green: Come back at like 1:30 ready to do some "work"
20/05/2019, 09:52 - Greg: Nice
20/05/2019, 09:53 - Greg: I know from personal experience a lunch pint fills one with motivation
20/05/2019, 09:55 - Will Green: I was thinking a glass of red
20/05/2019, 09:55 - Will Green: or maybe
20/05/2019, 09:55 - Will Green: some vodka
20/05/2019, 09:55 - Will Green: speaking of vodka

20/05/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: like influencer tier
20/05/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: and i actually don't think she's a catfish
20/05/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: it's pretty weird
20/05/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: oof
20/05/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: she's got 30k followers on insta

20/05/2019, 10:20 - Will Green: she's not even that fit

22/05/2019, 14:59 - Will Green: Nice
22/05/2019, 14:59 - Greg: Yeah maybe I should just stick to python so I can be a real pythonista
22/05/2019, 14:59 - Greg: Mmmm solve problems by importing modules I can
22/05/2019, 14:59 - Will Green: Python > java
22/05/2019, 15:00 - Will Green: For most jobs too
22/05/2019, 15:00 - Greg: Completely different uses
22/05/2019, 15:00 - Will Green: Well
22/05/2019, 15:00 - Will Green: At startups at least
22/05/2019, 15:00 - Greg: I'm comfortable enough with python
22/05/2019, 15:00 - Will Green: Idk if Pete ever really used java

22/05/2019, 15:01 - Greg: Kek
22/05/2019, 15:01 - Will Green: But as far as I'm aware that's pretty rare
22/05/2019, 15:01 - Will Green: It's just some legacy shit they have at Spotify

22/05/2019, 15:01 - Greg: They're both oop
22/05/2019, 15:01 - Greg: So it's pretty much all transferable
22/05/2019, 15:02 - Greg: And it's easier to learn python syntax
22/05/2019, 15:02 - Greg: So if I know it in java I can just write some pseudocode and it'll be python
22/05/2019, 15:10 - Will Green: yeah
22/05/2019, 15:10 - Will Green: true
22/05/2019, 15:10 - Will Green: it also looks good on your cv

28/05/2019, 17:06 - Greg: what youre talking about is egg humans
28/05/2019, 17:07 - Greg: im talking about human eggs
28/05/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: Hmmm
28/05/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: Yeah I think that makes sense
28/05/2019, 17:07 - Greg: an egg human is a regular human that has become an egg
28/05/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: Probably
28/05/2019, 17:08 - Greg: a human egg is an egg that has become a human
28/05/2019, 17:08 - Will Green: Of course
28/05/2019, 17:08 - Greg: and so therefor
28/05/2019, 17:08 - Greg: i am
28/05/2019, 17:09 - Greg: wait no
28/05/2019, 17:09 - Greg: so how am i chodey
28/05/2019, 17:09 - Greg: i still dont get that
28/05/2019, 17:10 - Greg: youre making no sense old man
28/05/2019, 17:10 - Will Green: well, the direction of the transition determines the scale
28/05/2019, 17:10 - Greg: im going to have to put you in a home
28/05/2019, 17:10 - Will Green: i.e. an egg human would be an egg with human sized proportions
28/05/2019, 17:10 - Will Green: a human egg would be human with egg size proportions
28/05/2019, 17:11 - Will Green: so one of the ways you would be long for an egg
28/05/2019, 17:11 - Will Green: and the other way you'd be short for an egg
28/05/2019, 17:11 - Greg: no
28/05/2019, 17:11 - Greg: the other way i would be short for a human
28/05/2019, 17:11 - Will Green: relative to your original state
28/05/2019, 17:12 - Greg: i would be a perfect egg size
28/05/2019, 17:12 - Greg: but a bad human size
28/05/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: why?
28/05/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: so you're saying you're bad human size already?
28/05/2019, 17:12 - Greg: because i am an egg
28/05/2019, 17:12 - Greg: and so i become a human
28/05/2019, 17:13 - Greg: so im an egg shaped human
28/05/2019, 17:13 - Will Green: no, you are a human and you became an egg
28/05/2019, 17:13 - Will Green: so you're a long egg
28/05/2019, 17:13 - Greg: exactly
28/05/2019, 17:13 - Greg: thats what im saying
28/05/2019, 17:13 - Greg: you said id be chody
28/05/2019, 17:13 - Will Green: great

28/05/2019, 17:14 - Greg: we arent
28/05/2019, 17:14 - Will Green: I thought one of the ways you would be chody

06/06/2019, 15:40 - Will Green: What a fucking tool

06/06/2019, 16:02 - Greg: You're just jealous of them gains
06/06/2019, 16:02 - Will Green: Can you even inject like a reasonable amount of synthol without it fucking you up?

06/06/2019, 16:31 - Will Green: Why is he wearing a grey long-sleeve with the union jack on it?
06/06/2019, 16:32 - Will Green: All I've ever wanted is disproportionately big arms...
06/06/2019, 16:32 - Greg: His range of motion must be in the single digits

09/06/2019, 21:40 - Will Green: DopE
09/06/2019, 22:49 - Greg: Just drove past a car with lua in its number plate
09/06/2019, 22:49 - Greg: It's a sign
09/06/2019, 22:59 - Will Green: notch is calling
09/06/2019, 23:23 - Will Green: you coming on lad
09/06/2019, 23:36 - Greg: On ma way

10/06/2019, 18:06 - Will Green: Mc in a bit?
10/06/2019, 18:17 - Greg: ye

10/06/2019, 19:20 - Greg: skillful
10/06/2019, 19:20 - Will Green: The toying
10/06/2019, 19:20 - Will Green: No OG qween
10/06/2019, 19:20 - Greg: i can see some deep thought went into that
10/06/2019, 19:23 - Will Green: It was pretty tricky to pull off
10/06/2019, 19:24 - Will Green: One of the harder mates to do from my box of tricks
10/06/2019, 20:01 - Will Green: I've had an idea for Mc
10/06/2019, 20:05 - Greg: go on
10/06/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: we should have a quest board in the house
10/06/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: where we list the things we want to do
10/06/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: add to it and check stuff off
10/06/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: will keep things interesting
10/06/2019, 20:16 - Greg: ye son
10/06/2019, 20:16 - Greg: we can do that
10/06/2019, 20:20 - Will Green: i'm on now btw
10/06/2019, 23:23 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
10/06/2019, 23:57 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
11/06/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: grant
11/06/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: sent me a video
11/06/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: of him drunk
11/06/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: shouting at me for leaving
11/06/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
11/06/2019, 16:06 - Greg: hahahaha
11/06/2019, 16:06 - Greg: fuck
11/06/2019, 16:06 - Greg: that's so weird
11/06/2019, 16:07 - Will Green: I know right
11/06/2019, 16:07 - Will Green: hahahaha
11/06/2019, 16:07 - Will Green: so fucking awkward
11/06/2019, 16:08 - Greg: You should reply with a pdf of a management styles handbook
11/06/2019, 16:09 - Greg: also what aux lifts can I do on my off days apart from rotator cuffs
11/06/2019, 16:11 - Will Green: aux?
11/06/2019, 16:12 - Greg: i can't remember what they're actually called
11/06/2019, 16:13 - Greg: Just like little lifts that will help with the big lifts
11/06/2019, 16:13 - Greg: Complimentary?
11/06/2019, 16:13 - Will Green: accessory?
11/06/2019, 16:13 - Greg: That's the word
11/06/2019, 16:14 - Will Green: rotator cuffs, rear delt (face pulls or reverse flys), hip flexer stuff like pigeon poses or walking leg rotations, also just windmilling is actually pretty good for your shoulder health
11/06/2019, 16:14 - Will Green: main things to focus on for that stuff are your shoulders and your hips basically
11/06/2019, 16:14 - Will Green: they're the two joints that always get fucked
11/06/2019, 16:15 - Greg: so you saying i should just stand and windmill
11/06/2019, 16:15 - Greg: aight
11/06/2019, 16:16 - Greg: get them pit clobberers in shape
11/06/2019, 16:49 - Greg: <Media omitted>
11/06/2019, 16:49 - Greg: cant wait
11/06/2019, 16:50 - Will Green: Think about all those hips you'll be opening
11/06/2019, 16:51 - Greg: gotta get those leg rotators in too
11/06/2019, 16:51 - Greg: <Media omitted>
11/06/2019, 16:51 - Will Green: Haha that's not them
11/06/2019, 16:51 - Will Green: I've forgotten what they're called
11/06/2019, 16:51 - Will Green: It's when you raise your thigh up
11/06/2019, 16:51 - Will Green: Then rotate the leg 90 degrees outwards
11/06/2019, 16:53 - Greg: virgin supination vs chad pronation
11/06/2019, 16:55 - Greg: this pigeon pose shit is impossible
11/06/2019, 16:55 - Greg: i dont know if im just unflexable or if im shoving my body into a shape thats actually damaging
11/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: Really!
11/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: I think my weird hip flexibility makes it easy for me
11/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: Ease in to it
11/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: Don't push through any pain
11/06/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: Just do it until you feel a stretch
11/06/2019, 16:59 - Greg: you have weird full body flexiblity
11/06/2019, 18:24 - Will Green: Nah it's just my legs really
11/06/2019, 18:24 - Will Green: And my hips
11/06/2019, 18:25 - Will Green: My arms are fairly normal
11/06/2019, 19:03 - Will Green: Thanks for cropping me out fam
11/06/2019, 19:03 - Will Green: Has that made it to your hinge?
11/06/2019, 19:04 - Greg: not everything is about you will
11/06/2019, 19:04 - Greg: but its slightly off centre actually
11/06/2019, 19:04 - Will Green: It's so warped
11/06/2019, 19:04 - Greg: perfect for a circle
11/06/2019, 19:07 - Greg: adam seems to be the continuity in our dps
11/06/2019, 19:07 - Greg: maybe theres something about him
11/06/2019, 19:08 - Greg: the light bends in a flattering way around his huge muscles to make everyone else shine too
11/06/2019, 22:07 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
11/06/2019, 22:07 - Will Green: After having chicken and rice
11/06/2019, 22:07 - Will Green: Two scotch eggs
11/06/2019, 22:07 - Will Green: And a huel
11/06/2019, 22:08 - Greg: that huge vein on his foot shows through his sock
11/06/2019, 22:08 - Greg: why does he have such a large spoon for such small yoghurts
11/06/2019, 22:22 - Will Green: He had to go back and get a smaller spoon
11/06/2019, 22:22 - Will Green: And yes that vein is very weird
12/06/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: I'm going to buy an Ableton Push
12/06/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: I have decided
12/06/2019, 10:32 - Will Green: also
12/06/2019, 10:32 - Will Green: which bars did you get?
12/06/2019, 10:32 - Will Green: my usual quest go to is out of stock
12/06/2019, 10:32 - Will Green: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quest-Nutrition-grams-Cookies-Cream/dp/B00I0DI0Z6/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=quest+bars&qid=1560331868&s=gateway&sr=8-5 :(
12/06/2019, 14:55 - Greg: Good decision
12/06/2019, 14:55 - Greg: Optimum Nutrition whipped bites
12/06/2019, 14:55 - Greg: Choc
12/06/2019, 15:04 - Will Green: I wanna make some rad synthwave
12/06/2019, 15:05 - Will Green: make some a e s t h e t i c tunes
12/06/2019, 15:05 - Will Green: home 2.0
12/06/2019, 15:05 - Will Green: they look grim
12/06/2019, 15:05 - Will Green: what do they taste like?
12/06/2019, 15:07 - Greg: Better get started on your music theory
12/06/2019, 15:07 - Greg: Nigga they look like Swiss rolls what are you talking about
12/06/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: yeppp
12/06/2019, 15:07 - Will Green: anything you'd recommend?
12/06/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: apparently there's some book that's like
12/06/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: THE book
12/06/2019, 15:08 - Will Green: i've forgotten what it's called though
12/06/2019, 15:08 - Greg: I happen to know a professional keys teacher
12/06/2019, 15:08 - Greg: I usually ask him
12/06/2019, 15:09 - Greg: You should try and find one of them
12/06/2019, 15:09 - Will Green: I played piano when I was younger
12/06/2019, 15:09 - Will Green: I feel pretty comfortable
12/06/2019, 15:09 - Greg: What
12/06/2019, 15:09 - Greg: Not playing you dope
12/06/2019, 15:09 - Greg: Theory
12/06/2019, 15:09 - Greg: And retard can hit keys
12/06/2019, 15:10 - Greg: Any*
12/06/2019, 15:13 - Greg: He's like my Pete of music
12/06/2019, 15:13 - Greg: Gotta fully utilise the BigBrains
12/06/2019, 15:35 - Greg: <Media omitted>
12/06/2019, 15:35 - Greg: the brain provides
12/06/2019, 15:35 - Greg: https://gb.abrsm.org/en/theory2018/free-practice-materials/
12/06/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: sorry, someone came over
12/06/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: i was going to go on to say
12/06/2019, 15:35 - Will Green: I need to learn theory
12/06/2019, 15:38 - Greg: this is good reference material
12/06/2019, 15:38 - Greg: http://tobyrush.com/theorypages/pdf/complete.pdf
12/06/2019, 15:41 - Will Green: Bigbrain Pete
12/06/2019, 15:42 - Will Green: Is that more about music theory generally
12/06/2019, 15:42 - Will Green: For both performing and composing?
12/06/2019, 15:42 - Will Green: Or just composing?
12/06/2019, 15:43 - Greg: its the same thing
12/06/2019, 15:43 - Greg: there isnt any composition focused music theory
12/06/2019, 15:43 - Will Green: That's not quite true
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: I know what you mean
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Greg: if you cant play it and understand it you cant write it
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: But when I think of performance I think of reading music
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Greg: i mean you can
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Greg: but itll just be a stab in the dark
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: And learning scales
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Greg: well
12/06/2019, 15:44 - Greg: thats wrong
12/06/2019, 15:45 - Greg: composing takes different skills than reading and play music
12/06/2019, 15:45 - Greg: but in terms of theory its the same
12/06/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: I know it does
12/06/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: That's why I'm asking
12/06/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: Does it cover both
12/06/2019, 15:46 - Greg: but in terms of theory its the same
12/06/2019, 15:46 - Will Green: Or is it just stuff relevant for composing
12/06/2019, 15:47 - Greg: if you want to do theory based composition you cant just go straight into writing
12/06/2019, 15:47 - Greg: you need to play first
12/06/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: No, you're missing whst I said
12/06/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: Does it teach stuff to do with performance
12/06/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: That way
12/06/2019, 15:47 - Will Green: As in, read and play music
12/06/2019, 15:48 - Will Green: Hmmm
12/06/2019, 15:48 - Will Green: I'm not sure that's true is it?
12/06/2019, 15:48 - Will Green: I know plenty of people who write music who aren't particularly great at playing keys
12/06/2019, 15:48 - Greg: i mean obviously you can write music with literally no understand of how music works
12/06/2019, 15:50 - Greg: but youll just be putting together sounds that you think sound nice
12/06/2019, 15:50 - Greg: without understand why
12/06/2019, 15:51 - Greg: if thats all you want to do there isnt much point learning theory
12/06/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: hmmmm
12/06/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: is it easier to put sounds together that sound nice if you understand theory
12/06/2019, 15:52 - Greg: absolutly
12/06/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: okay
12/06/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: i guess that's the crux of it
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: it increases your ability to make things that sound nice
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: using theory
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: rather than playing around
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: okay
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Greg: yeah
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Will Green: i'll learn theory
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Greg: the way its been explained to me
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Greg: is that you dont activly think about theory when you play and write
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Greg: its something that runs in the background that works like intuition
12/06/2019, 15:53 - Greg: which makes sense
12/06/2019, 15:54 - Will Green: yeah
12/06/2019, 15:54 - Will Green: that makes sense
12/06/2019, 15:54 - Will Green: so where should I start with music theory?
12/06/2019, 15:54 - Will Green: one of those links you sent?
12/06/2019, 15:54 - Greg: read that picture with what chris said
12/06/2019, 15:54 - Greg: go over the ABRSM stuff
12/06/2019, 15:55 - Will Green: there must be some youtube stuff for music theory
12/06/2019, 15:55 - Will Green: yeah I had a look
12/06/2019, 15:55 - Greg: there will be
12/06/2019, 15:55 - Greg: and you should probably watch some of them too
12/06/2019, 15:55 - Greg: but as he said
12/06/2019, 15:55 - Greg: theory is dry and boring
12/06/2019, 15:56 - Greg: its just actual work to learn it
12/06/2019, 16:00 - Will Green: yeah
12/06/2019, 16:00 - Will Green: there's a dude who does theory about popular songs
12/06/2019, 16:00 - Will Green: which is quite engaging
12/06/2019, 16:00 - Will Green: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwgLAZ3AtaI
12/06/2019, 16:01 - Will Green: maybe I should get an actual keyboard
12/06/2019, 16:02 - Will Green: before getting a push
12/06/2019, 16:02 - Greg: ive got a babies first keyboard and stand you can have
12/06/2019, 16:03 - Will Green: how big is it though?
12/06/2019, 16:03 - Will Green: want something that can go on my desk
12/06/2019, 16:03 - Will Green: my new room is smol
12/06/2019, 16:03 - Greg: yeah so in that video you can fully appreciate how much theory knowledge goes into writing more interesting music
12/06/2019, 16:04 - Greg: all of the little things he must have done in the writing process that would just be guesswork
12/06/2019, 16:04 - Greg: oh right itll be too big then
12/06/2019, 16:04 - Greg: its a 61 key
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Greg: protip you should branch into jazz
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: I need a better sound card too
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Greg: theres a reason every single successful session musician is a hardcore jazzer
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: the one i got is shit
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: i'll get a scarlet red
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: thing
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: yeah
12/06/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: how do i get in to jazz
12/06/2019, 16:06 - Greg: first you spend years learning theory and have an active interest in jazz
12/06/2019, 16:06 - Greg: and then you just keep playing jazz
12/06/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: I think I only need 3 or 4 octaves
12/06/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: probably 4
12/06/2019, 16:06 - Greg: depends
12/06/2019, 16:07 - Greg: if you want to play music youll need at least 5
12/06/2019, 16:08 - Greg: even that is a bit restrictive
12/06/2019, 16:11 - Will Green: hmmmm
12/06/2019, 16:14 - Greg: so if you get a 49 key itll go down to C2
12/06/2019, 16:15 - Greg: and as luck would have it
12/06/2019, 16:16 - Greg: here are our boys vulf
12/06/2019, 16:16 - Greg: <Media omitted>
12/06/2019, 16:16 - Greg: throwing a C2b in
12/06/2019, 16:16 - Greg: and then youd be fucked
12/06/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: that dude change his picture on our issue tracking software
12/06/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
12/06/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: can't deal
12/06/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: nah i'd just use that fucking shift bend
12/06/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Novation-NOVLKE49MK2-Launchkey-Keyboard-Controller/dp/B00VVK2A3I/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=midi+keyboard&qid=1560354077&s=gateway&sr=8-18
12/06/2019, 16:25 - Greg: what a fucking picture
12/06/2019, 16:25 - Greg: oh shit
12/06/2019, 16:25 - Greg: just a single key
12/06/2019, 16:25 - Greg: and get your prebend down to a t
12/06/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: Heck ye
12/06/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: I feel like a 49 key is enough for me
12/06/2019, 16:50 - Greg: what will you want to be doing
12/06/2019, 16:51 - Will Green: Playing some simple stuff and writing music (playing chords and melodies with one or two hands across a few octaves)
12/06/2019, 16:51 - Will Green: I don't want to start playing funk and jazz keys
12/06/2019, 16:51 - Will Green: Like a madman
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Greg: you do
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Greg: but that will most likely suit your needs then
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Will Green: Yeah
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Greg: and novation are a decent company
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Will Green: I was actually pretty good on keys back in the day
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Will Green: But alas
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Will Green: I hate reading music
12/06/2019, 16:55 - Will Green: Or at least
12/06/2019, 16:56 - Will Green: Pitched music
12/06/2019, 16:56 - Greg: will with the ivory fingers
12/06/2019, 16:56 - Greg: reading music is ez
12/06/2019, 16:56 - Greg: just gotta stick the notes into the note hole
12/06/2019, 16:56 - Greg: boom
12/06/2019, 16:56 - Will Green: I can percussion music fine
12/06/2019, 16:56 - Will Green: But anything that's pitched is the absolute worst
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: To read and translate that to a key on a keyboard I found horrible
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Greg: thats the trick
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Greg: you dont do that
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Greg: you just drill it into your brain until a note = a key
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: yeah
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: I mean
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: I was a kid back then
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: so I probably didn't apply the best logic to learning it
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: I played everything by ear
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Greg: so you brain was ripe for absorbing knowldege
12/06/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: my mum hated it
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: cause she could read music
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: and she'd spend ages learning a song
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: and i'd listen to it once and just play it
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: without reading any music
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: triggered the shit out of her
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Greg: sounds like you were a bit of a prodigy
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: I think i'm much better at learning things now
12/06/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: generally
12/06/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: but I think that's true about anyonre
12/06/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: anyone*
12/06/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: I think you'd be surprised if you heard me play the piano
12/06/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: considering how little I actually played it
12/06/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: I was surprisingly good
12/06/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: I was shit at everything else though
12/06/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: and I don't really understand why i'm so bad at guitar
12/06/2019, 17:00 - Will Green: but I'm fucking shit at that
12/06/2019, 17:03 - Greg: You should buy that and surprise me
12/06/2019, 17:04 - Greg: Unless you learnt theory there isn't much to translate between guitar and piano
12/06/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: I mean
12/06/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: playing them is completely different
12/06/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: requires different fine-motor skills and co-ordination
12/06/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: keys are much more percussive
12/06/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: and more intuitive to me I think
12/06/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: easier to pick up
12/06/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: damn son
12/06/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: https://www.amazon.co.uk/M-Audio-Keystation-49MK3-USB-Powered-Connectivity/dp/B07DDN6TP6/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=midi+keyboard&qid=1560354077&s=gateway&sr=8-8
12/06/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: cheap as shit
12/06/2019, 17:12 - Will Green: and m-audio
12/06/2019, 17:23 - Greg: guitar is plenty percussive
12/06/2019, 17:23 - Greg: you just gotta slap them strings
12/06/2019, 17:24 - Greg: yeah thatll be fine
12/06/2019, 17:24 - Greg: looks like the smaller version of my one
12/06/2019, 17:24 - Will Green: I had an m-audio oxygen previously
12/06/2019, 17:24 - Will Green: which was great
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: but it was like
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: two octaves
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Greg: semi weigted
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Greg: disgusting
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: hmmm
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Greg: worst of both worlds
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Greg: but it'll be like that for all of them
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: really?
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: at that price range you mean?
12/06/2019, 17:25 - Will Green: was that novation one semi-weighted?
12/06/2019, 17:26 - Will Green: what exactly does that mean?
12/06/2019, 17:26 - Greg: that style of midi keyboard is usually semi
12/06/2019, 17:26 - Greg: its a perference thing really
12/06/2019, 17:27 - Greg: my piano is fully weighted
12/06/2019, 17:27 - Greg: so something like a synth wont be weighted
12/06/2019, 17:27 - Greg: so theres no resistance when you push a key down
12/06/2019, 17:27 - Greg: semi usually involves a spring on the key that simulates the weight of a hammer being pushed
12/06/2019, 17:29 - Greg: most of the mid-beginner range midi gear is usually semi
12/06/2019, 17:29 - Greg: personally i dont like how it feels
12/06/2019, 17:29 - Greg: but you should go to a music shop and try it
12/06/2019, 17:30 - Will Green: hmmm
12/06/2019, 17:30 - Will Green: I wonder if the keyboard we had at home was fully weighted
12/06/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: the novation one is actually un-weighted
12/06/2019, 17:44 - Greg: noice
12/06/2019, 17:44 - Greg: i didnt look at that one
12/06/2019, 17:44 - Greg: thats probably what you want
12/06/2019, 17:44 - Will Green: is un-weighted better than part-weighted?
12/06/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: oh
12/06/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: I see
12/06/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: the spring thing
12/06/2019, 17:45 - Greg: none are neccecarly better
12/06/2019, 17:45 - Greg: its just preference
12/06/2019, 17:45 - Greg: but synths are usually un-weighted
12/06/2019, 17:45 - Greg: and if thats what you want to use it for
12/06/2019, 18:03 - Will Green: But won't it be horrible to play?
12/06/2019, 18:03 - Will Green: I might try play some funk...
12/06/2019, 18:03 - Will Green: 🥴
12/06/2019, 18:04 - Greg: you should go to a music shop and try some
12/06/2019, 18:04 - Greg: but yes
12/06/2019, 18:04 - Greg: non weighted with funk i think feels bad
12/06/2019, 18:04 - Greg: you wanna be able to do those big hits on the 1
12/06/2019, 18:05 - Greg: its just not as satisfying if theres no weight behind it
12/06/2019, 18:10 - Greg: you should get a real book
12/06/2019, 18:10 - Greg: become a jazz man
12/06/2019, 18:10 - Greg: http://www.play-along.ch/notationz/Volume1C.PDF
12/06/2019, 18:25 - Greg: <Media omitted>
12/06/2019, 19:17 - Will Green: Yeah I'm gunna
12/06/2019, 19:17 - Will Green: I asked my mum
12/06/2019, 19:17 - Will Green: She said all the keys I played were weighted
12/06/2019, 19:17 - Will Green: And she said she doesn't like Un weighted
12/06/2019, 19:21 - Greg: weighted is far superior for piano
12/06/2019, 19:22 - Greg: but synth stuff i think unweighted is better
12/06/2019, 19:22 - Greg: since they dont have velocity
12/06/2019, 19:22 - Greg: so its just an on/off button
12/06/2019, 19:24 - Greg: the two people i know that play keys have both
12/06/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: I see
12/06/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: Isn't that why part-weighted exists?
12/06/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: That sort of makes sense
12/06/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: If you want to do both?
12/06/2019, 21:39 - Will Green: Mc
12/06/2019, 21:39 - Will Green: ?
12/06/2019, 21:47 - Greg: Yeah it's supposed to be a happy inbetween
12/06/2019, 21:47 - Greg: That's probably best for you tbh
12/06/2019, 21:48 - Greg: They aren't as bad as I'm making them out to be really
12/06/2019, 21:48 - Greg: Also I'm out atm
12/06/2019, 21:48 - Will Green: That's what I'm thinking
12/06/2019, 21:48 - Will Green: Cool

13/06/2019, 10:10 - Greg: why didnt those idiots just use python
13/06/2019, 10:10 - Greg: the superior language
13/06/2019, 10:11 - Will Green: java cucking me from getting free java
13/06/2019, 10:11 - Will Green: the ultimate
13/06/2019, 10:12 - Greg: are you wfh or have you managed to get into WhatsApp Web somehow
13/06/2019, 10:13 - Will Green: I removed the web filter
13/06/2019, 10:13 - Will Green: turns out they gave me a laptop that had the shit installed for plebby ops people
13/06/2019, 10:14 - Greg: Kek what
13/06/2019, 10:14 - Will Green: ye

13/06/2019, 10:14 - Will Green: kek
13/06/2019, 10:14 - Will Green: RIP account managers
13/06/2019, 10:14 - Greg: that's hilarious
13/06/2019, 10:14 - Will Green: I had to do some real weird shit to get rid of it
13/06/2019, 10:14 - Greg: im so much more secure in my chosen goal
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Greg: can dick around on the internet
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Greg: excellent
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: yep
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: it's the dream
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Greg: didn't you just give it to a man
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: nah
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Greg: don't they have men for that
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: I asked and she said I should just remove it
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: so I looked it up
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: and it's really hacky
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: because you're not meant to be able to remove it
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: I had to ask her for a root password to do it
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Will Green: but it worked
13/06/2019, 10:15 - Greg: lol you wot
13/06/2019, 10:16 - Greg: they just gave you root?
13/06/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: yeah, she had to
13/06/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: otherwise I would've had to wipe the whole machine
13/06/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: reinstall the OS
13/06/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: which would cost them money
13/06/2019, 10:16 - Will Green: cause I wouldn't be able to work for a day
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Greg: beautiful
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: but I tried the root pw again later
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: and they had changed it
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Greg: i always hear the big rule is always give users root access
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: so they aint totally stoop
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: however
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: they did send it to me on slack in plaintext
13/06/2019, 10:17 - Will Green: which I thought was quite amusing
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Greg: that's nice and retarded
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: she even deleted the message after
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: as if that would stop anything
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: after just putting it in plaintext
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Greg: stops the hackers
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Greg: it's gone
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Greg: deleted
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: yeah
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: it's like
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: when you kill someone
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Greg: ceases to exist
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: and then you put their body in a tank of acid
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: problem solved
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Will Green: didn't even happen did it
13/06/2019, 10:18 - Greg: what body
13/06/2019, 10:19 - Greg: it's gone
13/06/2019, 10:19 - Will Green: 😱
13/06/2019, 10:19 - Greg: does that mean that ops just spent all their time dicking around on the internet
13/06/2019, 10:20 - Greg: so they had to treat them like lil babby children
13/06/2019, 10:20 - Greg: or like just browsing pol all the tim.
13/06/2019, 10:21 - Will Green: i guess so
13/06/2019, 10:21 - Will Green: they probably spent loads of time on fb
13/06/2019, 10:21 - Will Green: at iwoca we had the same problem
13/06/2019, 10:21 - Will Green: everything that AMs did was tracked
13/06/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: and there was obviously a direct correlation between the amount of time they spent on our internal CRM and the amount of customer requests they dealt with
13/06/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: so when they realised they were all browsing for like 40% of the time they just blocked everything
13/06/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: and sure enough, productivity went up
13/06/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: what a miserable world we live in
13/06/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: meanwhile Pete and I were upstairs in our ivory tower being paid silly money to browse reddit
13/06/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: the dream
13/06/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: isn't capitalism great
13/06/2019, 10:24 - Greg: and now petes off in the neverending day of sweden

13/06/2019, 11:20 - Will Green: i'm gunna make a CBT app
13/06/2019, 11:21 - Will Green: do you think I should just make it a web app?
13/06/2019, 11:21 - Will Green: or should I go native
13/06/2019, 11:21 - Will Green: and use like
13/06/2019, 11:21 - Will Green: kotlin
13/06/2019, 11:21 - Will Green: or swift
13/06/2019, 11:25 - Greg: What are you going to want to do with it
13/06/2019, 11:25 - Greg: Just personal?
13/06/2019, 11:27 - Greg: I don't know much about apps tbh
13/06/2019, 11:27 - Greg: I tried but it wasn't very fun
13/06/2019, 11:27 - Greg: Might have been better if I used swift or something
13/06/2019, 11:48 - Will Green: I want to release it for free if it ends up being any good
13/06/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: but mainly I want to use it as a learning experience
13/06/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: I suppose I could make it a PWA
13/06/2019, 13:24 - Will Green: the fucking comments on home's soundcloud

16/06/2019, 13:01 - Greg: ???
16/06/2019, 13:01 - Greg: why not just play on pc then
16/06/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: Cause I wanna play in bed
16/06/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: And hooking it up to the TV and having a controller setup is effort
16/06/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: It's never as convenient as you think
16/06/2019, 13:02 - Will Green: Cause you have to switch inputs and monitors
16/06/2019, 13:03 - Will Green: Or plug it in with a giant hdmi cable
16/06/2019, 13:03 - Greg: >not just buying another pc
16/06/2019, 13:03 - Greg: heh ok kid
16/06/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: Hnmmmm
16/06/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: That's not a bad idea
16/06/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: Interesting

16/06/2019, 13:08 - Greg: new PC desk PC
16/06/2019, 13:08 - Greg: ezpz
16/06/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: True
16/06/2019, 13:09 - Will Green: But I'd want a small case for the TV PC
16/06/2019, 13:09 - Will Green: So new mobo needed probably
16/06/2019, 13:09 - Greg: youd need to buy a new mobo either way if youre buying a new pc
16/06/2019, 13:09 - Greg: just get some old compatible mini one
16/06/2019, 13:09 - Greg: and some low profile case
16/06/2019, 13:10 - Greg: though you would need a new mobo if youre buying new shit actually
16/06/2019, 13:10 - Greg: eh fuck it
16/06/2019, 13:10 - Greg: products good
16/06/2019, 13:10 - Greg: make happy

16/06/2019, 13:11 - Will Green: Two new mobos
16/06/2019, 13:12 - Greg: maybe theyll send a mobo tshirt with it
16/06/2019, 13:20 - Will Green: I wish
16/06/2019, 13:20 - Will Green: Maybe they'll send me a girlfriend with it
16/06/2019, 13:20 - Greg: aw yiss son
16/06/2019, 13:21 - Greg: everyone knows girls are the solution
16/06/2019, 19:10 - Will Green: I wanna try cbd
16/06/2019, 19:10 - Will Green: But vape is required for proper try
16/06/2019, 19:10 - Will Green: Hmmm
16/06/2019, 19:11 - Greg: This is a good regression
16/06/2019, 19:11 - Greg: Just vape weed like a normal human being
16/06/2019, 19:11 - Greg: Without the oh cbt pretense
16/06/2019, 19:53 - Will Green: Hmmm
16/06/2019, 19:53 - Will Green: Where does one get weed vape pods

17/06/2019, 10:49 - Greg: not CBD though
17/06/2019, 10:50 - Will Green: 😎
17/06/2019, 10:50 - Will Green: Full spectrum cool
17/06/2019, 10:50 - Greg: i knew youd go the most obnoxious way
17/06/2019, 10:51 - Greg: regular vape and cbd oil?
17/06/2019, 10:51 - Greg: nah gotta get my fucking cunt stick
17/06/2019, 10:52 - Greg: youd better not juul in front of me
17/06/2019, 10:52 - Greg: ill stick it in my usb port and download all your weed off it
17/06/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: i'm gunna juul all over you
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: and you're gunna juul with me
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: a juul is better than a vape
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: surely
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Greg: how do you figure that
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Greg: its literally a vape
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: yeah but like
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: not one of those weird DIY things
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: that has a tank
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: and you have to manually load your oils in
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: like some sort of weird cancer chemist
17/06/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: oh heck yeah
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Greg: so instead your questionable oils come preloaded in pods
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Greg: and that is better
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: I wanna know if you can get weed juul pods
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: i bet you can
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Greg: because someone else squeezed the oil in
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: yeah cause it's regulated init
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: I mean, you can manually add oil
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: but I don't want nicotine
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Greg: you can get oils that are regulated
17/06/2019, 10:55 - Will Green: obviously
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: but you can't get pods that are nicotine free
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: so you'd have to get normal pods
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: finish them or drain them
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: then fill them with something + CBD oil
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: and add some flavour to it or something
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: so much effort
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Greg: or just get a bottle of premix
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Greg: youre going off the rails will
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: I wonder if they'll get stopped in the post
17/06/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: I think CBD is still questionable
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Will Green: isn't it?
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Will Green: i don't really know what the law is on it
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Will Green: maybe I should've looked in to that before ordering it online
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Will Green: kek
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Greg: trying to cure you ailments with weed
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Will Green: wut

17/06/2019, 10:57 - Will Green: forget about everything that's wrong with the world
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Greg: you need actual weed for that
17/06/2019, 10:57 - Greg: not cbd
17/06/2019, 10:58 - Will Green: I've heard that's not true
17/06/2019, 10:58 - Will Green: cbd is meant to be better than thc for anxiety
17/06/2019, 10:58 - Will Green: i will probably try thc too
17/06/2019, 10:58 - Greg: jesus christ
17/06/2019, 10:58 - Greg: just buy weed you fucking digital autist
17/06/2019, 10:59 - Will Green: can we get juuls in minecraft?
17/06/2019, 10:59 - Will Green: we can fly around vaping on our pens
17/06/2019, 11:00 - Greg: you disgust me
17/06/2019, 11:00 - Will Green: imma ask harry
17/06/2019, 11:00 - Will Green: for the druggos
17/06/2019, 11:01 - Greg: then you can ditch your usb stick when you realise it does nothing
17/06/2019, 11:01 - Greg: harrys gunna find it hilarious that you got CBD instead of weed
17/06/2019, 11:02 - Will Green: But I don't want to smoke weed with baccy
17/06/2019, 11:02 - Will Green: And I don't want to role
17/06/2019, 11:02 - Will Green: And I don't want to have to fuck around with oils
17/06/2019, 11:02 - Greg: stop being a pussy and learn to roll
17/06/2019, 11:02 - Will Green: I want something convenient
17/06/2019, 11:02 - Greg: and just do little baby blunts
17/06/2019, 11:02 - Greg: ez

17/06/2019, 11:04 - Will Green: I had a blood test this morning
17/06/2019, 11:04 - Will Green: and they took so much fucking blood
17/06/2019, 11:04 - Will Green: it was ridiculous
17/06/2019, 11:04 - Will Green: I was like "hey this is taking longer than normal" in my head
17/06/2019, 11:04 - Will Green: looked down
17/06/2019, 11:04 - Will Green: and she'd taken a fucking vat of my blood
17/06/2019, 11:04 - Will Green: like some sort of vampire
17/06/2019, 11:05 - Greg: blood letting is valid medicine
17/06/2019, 11:05 - Greg: just like juuling cbd
17/06/2019, 11:11 - Will Green: Mmmm
17/06/2019, 11:11 - Will Green: Maybe I should've gone to see Dr jinx
17/06/2019, 11:11 - Will Green: I hear he's got something for feelings
17/06/2019, 11:12 - Greg: sounds like a great idea my man

17/06/2019, 18:03 - Will Green: am not convinced by browns
17/06/2019, 18:03 - Will Green: i'm typing on browns now
17/06/2019, 18:03 - Will Green: they're a little bit more mushy
17/06/2019, 18:03 - Greg: They are
17/06/2019, 18:03 - Greg: I'm happy with the tradeoff though
17/06/2019, 18:03 - Greg: They're just so fucking noisy
17/06/2019, 18:04 - Will Green: yeah, that's why I have browns at work
17/06/2019, 18:04 - Will Green: and blues at home
17/06/2019, 18:04 - Will Green: blues at work are just not acceptable
17/06/2019, 18:05 - Greg: of course
17/06/2019, 18:05 - Greg: if you take blues to work you deserve to use domes
17/06/2019, 18:07 - Will Green: you deserve to get domed
17/06/2019, 18:07 - Will Green: the two guys next to me just went out with their juuls
17/06/2019, 18:07 - Will Green: they were charging them on the same usb-c dongle

17/06/2019, 18:09 - Will Green: <Media omitted>

17/06/2019, 18:15 - Will Green: i'm not contagious
17/06/2019, 18:15 - Will Green: unless it's mono
17/06/2019, 18:15 - Will Green: but I doubt it's mono
17/06/2019, 18:16 - Will Green: it's most likely either an allergy or LPR
17/06/2019, 18:16 - Greg: fuck
17/06/2019, 18:16 - Greg: brown is out of stock
17/06/2019, 18:16 - Greg: gotta wait the 10 days

17/06/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: some long name
17/06/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: it's like acid reflux
17/06/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: minus the heart burn
17/06/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: but it fucks up your voice box and your throat
17/06/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: i'm on pills for it now
17/06/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: and antihistamines
17/06/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: get bloods back on thursday to rule out mono, other infections and cancer
17/06/2019, 18:19 - Greg: pilly willy
17/06/2019, 18:20 - Greg: poppin like nothing
17/06/2019, 18:20 - Will Green: yep
17/06/2019, 18:20 - Will Green: sux
17/06/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: whatever it is, it isn't going to be good news at this point
17/06/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: all of the possible remaining things kinda suck
17/06/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: obviously some of them are significantly worse than others
17/06/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: but all of them are shit
17/06/2019, 18:21 - Greg: eh
17/06/2019, 18:21 - Greg: im sure itll be fine
17/06/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: sad vibes
17/06/2019, 18:22 - Greg: you just get all up in your head
17/06/2019, 18:22 - Greg: have a doob n listen to some jazz
17/06/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: I have a strong suspicion that it's LPR. And if it is, it's really fucking annoying... Because it basically means I'll have to avoid spicy food, alcohol and caffeine...
17/06/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: But I suppose that's better than cancer so if it is that I can't really explain
17/06/2019, 18:22 - Greg: perfect time to become a jazzman
17/06/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: complain*
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Greg: all youve got left is weed
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: true
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: but smoking is meant to trigger it too
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: RIP
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: won't know until I've taken meds for a significant amount of time anyway
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Greg: bake some fun protein balls
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: true
17/06/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: vaping isn't as bad either
17/06/2019, 18:24 - Will Green: supposedly

17/06/2019, 18:35 - Greg: so you have to sleep at an angle?
17/06/2019, 18:38 - Will Green: it says sleeping at a slight angle can help
17/06/2019, 18:38 - Will Green: yeah
17/06/2019, 18:39 - Will Green: basically keeping your head above your stomach
17/06/2019, 18:40 - Will Green: so that if there is a bit of stomach acid coming out, it's less likely to end up in your voice box or throat
17/06/2019, 19:35 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
17/06/2019, 19:41 - Greg: youre so good at chess my man

17/06/2019, 19:48 - Will Green: I should probably do legs
17/06/2019, 19:48 - Will Green: It's just so unenjoyable
17/06/2019, 19:48 - Will Green: Ugh
17/06/2019, 19:49 - Greg: it is
17/06/2019, 19:49 - Greg: its awful

17/06/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
17/06/2019, 20:11 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
17/06/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: They're just like "something wrong. He has bad"
17/06/2019, 20:12 - Will Green: "Test him"
17/06/2019, 20:12 - Greg: anthony greentano here

17/06/2019, 23:25 - Greg: At the pub
17/06/2019, 23:38 - Will Green: Ight
18/06/2019, 00:32 - Greg: are you still looking at memes on your phone
18/06/2019, 00:32 - Greg: can you guide me with a ux thing
18/06/2019, 00:33 - Will Green: Ye
18/06/2019, 00:36 - Greg: oka yso
18/06/2019, 00:36 - Greg: for the thing im making
18/06/2019, 00:36 - Greg: on the subreddit
18/06/2019, 00:36 - Greg: they have challenges
18/06/2019, 00:36 - Greg: and for some reason
18/06/2019, 00:37 - Greg: they have the same number challenge
18/06/2019, 00:37 - Greg: but they have a permutation of easy/medium/hard
18/06/2019, 00:37 - Greg: so you can have all or one of any
18/06/2019, 00:37 - Greg: so the way ive made it is
18/06/2019, 00:37 - Greg: <Media omitted>
18/06/2019, 00:37 - Greg: like so
18/06/2019, 00:38 - Greg: you select the number of challenge and then get to choose by difficulty
18/06/2019, 00:38 - Greg: but the hardness of the challenge isnt related to the type of problem
18/06/2019, 00:38 - Greg: its just some other random unrelated challenge that is harder than the same number
18/06/2019, 00:39 - Greg: i mean im making it for massive autistis so theyre perfectly capable of figuring it out
18/06/2019, 00:39 - Greg: but i was wondering if you had some boilerplate ui guideline to follow
18/06/2019, 00:40 - Will Green: UI?
18/06/2019, 00:40 - Will Green: It's a cli tool right?
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Greg: e
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Greg: ye
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Greg: but
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Greg: i dont think i mean ui
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Greg: i think i just mean
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Will Green: UX
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Greg: a thing that makes sense upon seeing
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Will Green: I would just reindex then
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Will Green: Them
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Will Green: As in
18/06/2019, 00:41 - Will Green: Generate some other number for them
18/06/2019, 00:42 - Will Green: And display that unique identifier
18/06/2019, 00:42 - Will Green: Depends how important the link to the actual reddit challenges is
18/06/2019, 00:42 - Will Green: Are you expecting people to complete them there and then go to reddit in their browser and post referencing the number?
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Greg: no not at all
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Greg: i made it for the purpose of replacing a tab in my browser
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: Then I'd generate a unique I'd for each
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: If they're unrelated to eachother
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: Just split them out
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: The hierarchy doesn't make sense
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Greg: yeah its weird
18/06/2019, 00:43 - Greg: so that screenshot i just sent you
18/06/2019, 00:44 - Will Green: I'd still keep the difficulty label
18/06/2019, 00:44 - Greg: this is the "hard" task
18/06/2019, 00:44 - Will Green: I'd just ditch the reddit numbers

18/06/2019, 00:45 - Will Green: Yeah, just split then
18/06/2019, 00:45 - Will Green: Ditch the reddit numbers
18/06/2019, 00:45 - Will Green: It looks pretty damn hard
18/06/2019, 00:45 - Will Green: Can you use libraries?

18/06/2019, 00:46 - Greg: yeah

18/06/2019, 00:46 - Greg: each number has a lookup table of notes
18/06/2019, 00:46 - Will Green: That would be easy
18/06/2019, 00:46 - Greg: depending on line
18/06/2019, 00:46 - Will Green: You could just give it every chord
18/06/2019, 00:46 - Will Green: And match them
18/06/2019, 00:46 - Will Green: Is there bonuses for making it smaller?
18/06/2019, 00:47 - Will Green: On jsfiddle there's a bunch of challenges like that
18/06/2019, 00:47 - Will Green: For css
18/06/2019, 00:47 - Greg: sort of
18/06/2019, 00:47 - Will Green: I.e. Style a page like this example image with as little css as possible
18/06/2019, 00:47 - Will Green: They're actually cool
18/06/2019, 00:47 - Greg: you just post your solution in the post comments
18/06/2019, 00:47 - Greg: obviously better solutions get more upvotes
18/06/2019, 00:48 - Greg: but its more of a self challenge system

18/06/2019, 00:48 - Will Green: I see
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Will Green: Do one with TDD
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Greg: but its for programming autists
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Will Green: It'll make you wanna kill yourself
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Greg: i dont expect them to cheat themsleves
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Greg: TDD?
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Will Green: Test driven development
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Greg: is this a picture someones made pure css
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Will Green: You write your tests before your program
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Will Green: Yep
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Greg: people keep talking about TDD on  treehouse
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Greg: i dont understand how it works in practice
18/06/2019, 00:49 - Greg: surely you have to see if a thing works first
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Will Green: They did it at iwoca a lot
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Will Green: It makes a lot of sense really
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Greg: like
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Will Green: It's just hard to get in to that frame of mind I think
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Greg: i get if its a thing thats possible
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Greg: you write a test based on a function to do a thing
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Greg: then once you test runs
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Will Green: You start off really abstract
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Greg: its easy game to implement
18/06/2019, 00:50 - Will Green: Make it pass
18/06/2019, 00:51 - Greg: and you start at the highest level possible
18/06/2019, 00:51 - Will Green: Things like TDD and frameworks are what makes me not want to get in to FE
18/06/2019, 00:52 - Will Green: There's so much flavour of the month

18/06/2019, 00:53 - Will Green: Then prepare to have everything you've learnt blown out of the water
18/06/2019, 00:53 - Will Green: As you start combining markup, css and js in to the same files
18/06/2019, 00:53 - Will Green: Which are then bundled using webpack
18/06/2019, 00:53 - Will Green: To make one giant bit of javascript
18/06/2019, 00:54 - Will Green: 🤯
18/06/2019, 00:54 - Will Green: Honestly, look at how react and JSX work with webpack
18/06/2019, 00:54 - Will Green: It's fucking madness

20/06/2019, 15:48 - Greg: then run it through some cheese cloth

20/06/2019, 16:17 - Greg: So you can squeeze it to get all the juices out
20/06/2019, 16:19 - Greg: Tbh I think a coffee filter would be fine
20/06/2019, 16:19 - Greg: But we had cheese cloth
20/06/2019, 16:19 - Greg: So used it
20/06/2019, 16:25 - Will Green: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Soulhand-Coffee-Machine-Dripper-Adjustable/dp/B07GDB7JKR/ref=asc_df_B07GDB7JKR/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309862973979&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1232944947518597272&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9045944&hvtargid=pla-524492829111&psc=1
20/06/2019, 16:26 - Will Green: this thing looks fancy af
20/06/2019, 16:26 - Greg: >a machine for cold brew
20/06/2019, 16:26 - Greg: that's retarded
20/06/2019, 16:27 - Greg: it's just a £30 filter
20/06/2019, 16:27 - Will Green: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hario-Mizudashi-Cold-Coffee-Brown/dp/B00IJ3O0Y2/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=cold+brew+coffee&qid=1561044436&s=kitchen&sr=1-3

20/06/2019, 16:28 - Greg: oh will
20/06/2019, 16:28 - Greg: you and your rampant capitalism
20/06/2019, 16:28 - Will Green: what?
20/06/2019, 16:28 - Will Green: I'm still going to have to buy a jug and some filters....
20/06/2019, 16:28 - Will Green: which i bet will add up to like £10
20/06/2019, 16:28 - Will Green: why not just buy something that's specifically made for cold brewing coffee
20/06/2019, 16:29 - Greg: because you can get a jug and filter you can use for many other purposes
20/06/2019, 16:30 - Greg: that will do the same
20/06/2019, 16:31 - Will Green: but if I want a jug for other purposes i'll need to get a jug
20/06/2019, 16:31 - Will Green: because the other jug will be full of cold brew coffee in my fridge
20/06/2019, 16:32 - Greg: youre going to have constant cold brew?
20/06/2019, 16:32 - Greg: damn

20/06/2019, 16:33 - Will Green: and i'll want to have it most mornings
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Greg: you should go the chest freezer route
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Greg: get one to go where your table used to be
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Greg: make like 100l of cold brew
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Greg: freeze it in mug sized portions
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Greg: then every night you can plop a chunk in a mug
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Greg: and put it in the fridge
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Will Green: nice
20/06/2019, 16:34 - Will Green: i like that
20/06/2019, 16:35 - Greg: shame your freezer is so disappointing
20/06/2019, 16:35 - Greg: and full of chicken
20/06/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: indeed
20/06/2019, 16:36 - Will Green: maybe I should just freeze the chicken in cold brew coffee
20/06/2019, 16:36 - Will Green: so i can get my morning protein and caffeine in one hit
20/06/2019, 16:36 - Greg: marinate your chicken in coffee

20/06/2019, 17:32 - Will Green: actual milk
20/06/2019, 17:33 - Greg: i dont really like actual milk tbh
20/06/2019, 17:33 - Greg: all nut/help milks are way nicer
20/06/2019, 17:33 - Greg: and i have my coffee and tea black
20/06/2019, 17:33 - Greg: so i never even use it for that
20/06/2019, 17:33 - Greg: oat milks are generally pretty nice too
20/06/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: I've been having almond milk for the last 6 months or so
20/06/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: It's p nice
20/06/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: But not as nice as normal milk imo
20/06/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: Will give oat milk a go
20/06/2019, 17:34 - Greg: try hemp milk
20/06/2019, 17:35 - Greg: thats pretty tasty
20/06/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: i fucking hate it when people put milk in coffee

20/06/2019, 17:41 - Greg: when i had so much fucking coffee
20/06/2019, 17:41 - Greg: it literally just gave me an anxiety spike
20/06/2019, 17:41 - Will Green: how could anyone ever willingly want a less flavoursome coffee that contains loads of fat and like 400 calories
20/06/2019, 17:41 - Will Green: and costs significantly more

21/06/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: no, I don't need red meat
21/06/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: i need to avoid red meat
21/06/2019, 12:59 - Will Green: i can have it if it's lean
21/06/2019, 12:59 - Greg: oh shit son

21/06/2019, 14:00 - Will Green: apparently that's pretty good
21/06/2019, 14:01 - Greg: but
21/06/2019, 14:01 - Greg: soda carbonated
21/06/2019, 14:01 - Greg: isnt that bad for tum tum
21/06/2019, 14:01 - Will Green: hence the lime
21/06/2019, 14:01 - Will Green: apparently it neutralises it a bit
21/06/2019, 14:01 - Greg: bruh
21/06/2019, 14:02 - Greg: just do gin and lime juice
21/06/2019, 14:02 - Greg: itll taste peng af
21/06/2019, 14:02 - Will Green: that has the opposite effect

01/07/2019, 15:18 - Greg: did you put your dick in the dob
01/07/2019, 15:18 - Will Green: was really good, but she was so hard to read
01/07/2019, 15:18 - Will Green: it was super fucking weird
01/07/2019, 15:18 - Will Green: i did not
01/07/2019, 15:18 - Greg: you fucking flaminal
01/07/2019, 15:18 - Will Green: we got off with eachother on the tube though and some drunks shouted shit at us which was fun
01/07/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: 'stick it in her'
01/07/2019, 15:19 - Will Green: nice.
01/07/2019, 15:19 - Greg: idiot
01/07/2019, 15:19 - Greg: they were giving you advice
01/07/2019, 15:19 - Greg: did you forget to flex
01/07/2019, 15:19 - Greg: i bet you forgot to flex
01/07/2019, 15:22 - Greg: also the phrasing "we got off with each other" sounds really fucking weird to me
01/07/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: yeah
01/07/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: it did to me too
01/07/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: but i didn't know how else to say it
01/07/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: kissed
01/07/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: but kissed sounds like
01/07/2019, 15:22 - Will Green: a lil peck
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: we were going at it for a good 5 mins
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: hence the reaction from the drunk men
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: totally called for tbh
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: can't blame 'em
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Greg: snoggin
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Greg: the classic
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: yeah
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: that sounds grimmer though
01/07/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: imo
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Greg: oh sorry
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Greg: im sure it was very classy
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: hahaha
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: anyway
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: that wasn't the weirdest bit
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Greg: hmu with them pics boi
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: she kept making jokes
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: that were like
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: good jokes
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: but then
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: she'd sort of
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: linger on them for too long
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: or take them too far
01/07/2019, 15:24 - Will Green: almost a bit like an autistic person would
01/07/2019, 15:25 - Greg: perfect
01/07/2019, 15:25 - Greg: give me an example

01/07/2019, 15:26 - Will Green: Wow those two screenshots lined up perfectly on WhatsApp
01/07/2019, 15:26 - Will Green: Weird
01/07/2019, 15:26 - Greg: kek
01/07/2019, 15:27 - Greg: ive seen her on hindge
01/07/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: So like, she'd make some joke like about something I'd say that's something she doesn't agree with
01/07/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: For example
01/07/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: I said I was having peanut butter
01/07/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: But it was smooth
01/07/2019, 15:27 - Will Green: And she was like "Omg why not crunchy" etc. (Hilarious)
01/07/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: And she'd say like "this ends here"
01/07/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: As in like, exaggerating saying she doesn't want to talk to me anymore
01/07/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: And then she'd literally not talk to me for about a minute to make the point
01/07/2019, 15:28 - Will Green: To the point where it was just awkward and not funny anymore
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: That's one example
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Greg: y i k e s
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: But it happened with quite a few things
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: Do you get what I mean?
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: Other than that, she was super nice
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: So it's weird
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: O really
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: You match?
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Greg: no
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Greg: i decided she looked a bit like a gremlin
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Greg: so i didnt
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: Hahahahaha
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: Wow
01/07/2019, 15:29 - Will Green: Did she like you?
01/07/2019, 15:30 - Greg: dont think so?

07/07/2019, 22:30 - Will Green: so she listens to them

07/07/2019, 22:30 - Greg: how do you add a band to a playlist without knowing who they are

07/07/2019, 22:36 - Will Green: and I think I might be getting a famous case of the munchies
07/07/2019, 22:36 - Greg: they should just sell the bubbles of air inside the aero

10/07/2019, 21:00 - Will Green: I need to come up with a name for a parent company for the projects me and my pals are working on
I know the sort of a e s t h e t i c I want for the brand
but aint got a name
figured you might have some ideas
I want the whole brand to be very vaporwave/windows95
and i'm working on the website now - it's going to be a windows95 desktop, the shortcuts on the desktop will be the software we're working on
and there will be a folder called 'team' on the desktop that opens up a folder with photos of us in it
and the trash can will be full of .exe files of our old projects that never made it
definitely want the name to be suffixed with 'soft'
like neversoft / microsoft
cause it fits the whole vibe
any ideas?
10/07/2019, 21:01 - Will Green: soz, pasted that from another chat
10/07/2019, 21:01 - Greg: did you write that

12/07/2019, 11:41 - Greg: Did you  In humans, soft poop is really one long, mostly continuous sausage before it comes out. It gets its "link" look because we tend to pinch off lengths of it with the anal sphincter as the poop emerges. If a person pinches hard enough, the poop separates into several turd units. If the person doesn't pinch that hard, the turds may stay connected.
12/07/2019, 11:41 - Will Green: Me later
12/07/2019, 11:41 - Greg: god they look so happy

13/07/2019, 15:41 - Greg: or are you going to make it so you can make new folders and files
13/07/2019, 15:41 - Will Green: I'm going to make it so you can drag folders, open folders, open start

13/07/2019, 16:07 - Greg: ye
13/07/2019, 16:07 - Will Green: is default
13/07/2019, 16:07 - Greg: the superior time
13/07/2019, 16:07 - Will Green: can you also make the folders draggable?
13/07/2019, 16:07 - Will Green: lol
13/07/2019, 16:07 - Greg: no
13/07/2019, 16:08 - Will Green: i'm styling folder windows
13/07/2019, 16:08 - Greg: ill drag ur mum
13/07/2019, 16:08 - Will Green: kk
13/07/2019, 16:08 - Greg: ill have a look
13/07/2019, 16:11 - Greg: i bet i could make it draggable
13/07/2019, 16:11 - Greg: but it would be extremely hacky
13/07/2019, 16:12 - Greg: how much jank are you tolerating
13/07/2019, 16:12 - Greg: whats your jank tolerance value
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Will Green: huh
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Will Green: what are the options
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Will Green: how janky we talking?
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Greg: so far ive only thought of an option
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Greg: without any research at all
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Greg: maybe ill do some of that first
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Will Green: there's a thing
13/07/2019, 16:15 - Will Green: on w3 schools
13/07/2019, 16:16 - Will Green: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp
13/07/2019, 16:16 - Will Green: it works perfectly
13/07/2019, 16:16 - Greg: kek
13/07/2019, 16:16 - Greg: ill have a look in a sec
13/07/2019, 16:16 - Greg: i was going to do some hacky like
13/07/2019, 16:16 - Will Green: need to change the z-index of the folders so they don't move over the top of the task bar
13/07/2019, 16:16 - Greg: mouse position stuff
13/07/2019, 16:17 - Greg: and change the width and height of your .folder-wrap
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Greg: oh shit
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: oh
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: no
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: don't do that
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Greg: thats pretty close to what w3 are doing
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Greg: but in a more sensible way
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Greg: as in
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Greg: their way
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Greg: is more sensible
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: you don't need to change the height of folder-wrap
13/07/2019, 16:19 - Will Green: it's wrapped in .desktop
13/07/2019, 16:20 - Will Green: which is full width and height
13/07/2019, 16:25 - Greg: okay
13/07/2019, 16:25 - Greg: is this acceptable
13/07/2019, 16:26 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/07/2019, 16:26 - Greg: it changes the styling in the html
13/07/2019, 16:26 - Greg: as w3 suggested
13/07/2019, 16:27 - Will Green: show me what it does
13/07/2019, 16:27 - Will Green: visually
13/07/2019, 16:27 - Will Green: do you then have to position absolutely on load?
13/07/2019, 16:27 - Will Green: i.e. i want the icons to always load top left
13/07/2019, 16:27 - Will Green: like on windows
13/07/2019, 16:28 - Greg: as in
13/07/2019, 16:28 - Greg: when you refresh the page
13/07/2019, 16:28 - Greg: they all go back?
13/07/2019, 16:29 - Will Green: ye
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Will Green: and when you first load the website
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Will Green: they're positioned top left
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Will Green: before you move them
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: ye
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: it all goes away when you refresh
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Will Green: push it boi
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: oh
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: its not done
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: that was just the bit that actually does the moving
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: i still need to make it work with the cursor
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: just
13/07/2019, 16:30 - Greg: checkin in
13/07/2019, 16:31 - Greg: theres a small problem
13/07/2019, 16:31 - Greg: and i dont know what it means
13/07/2019, 16:31 - Greg: you have to set the position to absolute
13/07/2019, 16:31 - Greg: and when you do that stuff starts moving itself
13/07/2019, 16:31 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/07/2019, 16:31 - Greg: like so
13/07/2019, 16:31 - Greg: but i dont know what absolute position is
13/07/2019, 16:32 - Greg: i thought you may be more useful than a google
13/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: oh yeah
13/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: that's fine\
13/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: i thought that would be the case
13/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: that's easily fixed
13/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: have you applied it to trash too?
13/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: also
13/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOlgChvU5cU

13/07/2019, 16:36 - Greg: object
13/07/2019, 16:36 - Greg: actually
13/07/2019, 16:36 - Greg: can you stick in another folder
13/07/2019, 16:37 - Greg: i just want to make sure it isnt going to do anything fucky like do it for all folders at once
13/07/2019, 16:38 - Will Green: just copy the div
13/07/2019, 16:38 - Will Green: with the 'folder-wrap' class
13/07/2019, 16:38 - Greg: i want to make a joke about copying you but its too high effort to actually go through with
13/07/2019, 16:39 - Greg: might have to end up giving them IDs or something
13/07/2019, 16:39 - Greg: id need something unique to grab
13/07/2019, 16:39 - Greg: actually
13/07/2019, 16:39 - Greg: the innerHTML could work
13/07/2019, 16:39 - Will Green: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqk3AqJsOLk

13/07/2019, 19:05 - Will Green: How do you fuck up a clock!
13/07/2019, 19:05 - Will Green: ?*
13/07/2019, 19:05 - Will Green: Isn't it just a script
13/07/2019, 19:05 - Will Green: That's like
13/07/2019, 19:05 - Will Green: Out of the box
13/07/2019, 19:05 - Greg: Sorta
13/07/2019, 19:05 - Greg: But it's a loop right
13/07/2019, 19:05 - Greg: You've gotta run it constantly
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Greg: But I don't want to be firing off an update every second or whatever
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Greg: So I'm setting it to run on the minute every 60 seconds
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Greg: As in
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Greg: It runs when you load the page
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Greg: Waits until 00
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Will Green: Is there's just something you can always pull date time from
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Greg: Then runs again and waits 60 seconds
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Will Green: It's like
13/07/2019, 19:06 - Will Green: A standard thing
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: That's not the problem
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: The time is fine
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: It's updating it on the page
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Will Green: Oh
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Will Green: Ajax
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: The fuck is an ajax
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: Is thst a pokemon
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Will Green: Google
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: Nah
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: Whatever it is
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Greg: It can be solved without another thing
13/07/2019, 19:07 - Will Green: Just find a jquery script that handles it with ajax
13/07/2019, 19:08 - Will Green: I bet there's about a million of them
13/07/2019, 19:08 - Will Green: And they all work perfectly
13/07/2019, 19:08 - Greg: We'll see
13/07/2019, 19:11 - Greg: oof
13/07/2019, 19:11 - Greg: done it
13/07/2019, 19:11 - Greg: ez
13/07/2019, 19:11 - Greg: you and your football teams
13/07/2019, 19:13 - Greg: If you want it done with whatever way that's fine
13/07/2019, 19:13 - Greg: Your site init
13/07/2019, 19:38 - Will Green: What
13/07/2019, 19:38 - Will Green: You're confusing
13/07/2019, 19:38 - Will Green: Speak normally
13/07/2019, 19:39 - Greg: Kek
13/07/2019, 19:39 - Greg: I've done it in pure js
13/07/2019, 19:39 - Greg: But if you want me to use some other thing
13/07/2019, 19:39 - Greg: Like jquery
13/07/2019, 19:39 - Greg: I shall do so
13/07/2019, 19:41 - Will Green: Whatever works and is easiest to implement
13/07/2019, 19:41 - Will Green: That's always the answer
13/07/2019, 19:41 - Greg: Noice
13/07/2019, 19:41 - Greg: I know pretty much nothing about js
13/07/2019, 19:42 - Greg: But I reckon that's the most straightforward way
13/07/2019, 19:56 - Will Green: That's a good reckon
13/07/2019, 19:56 - Will Green: I reckon you're wrong
13/07/2019, 19:56 - Will Green: And my way would have been infinitely easier
13/07/2019, 20:03 - Greg: Oh
13/07/2019, 20:03 - Greg: I reckon you're wrong
13/07/2019, 20:32 - Will Green: You on?
13/07/2019, 20:32 - Greg: eatin
13/07/2019, 20:32 - Will Green: How long?
13/07/2019, 20:32 - Greg: hmm
13/07/2019, 20:32 - Greg: 10
13/07/2019, 20:32 - Will Green: Cool
13/07/2019, 20:44 - Greg: oh shit son
13/07/2019, 20:44 - Greg: i think i got that draggin working
13/07/2019, 20:52 - Will Green: O shit
13/07/2019, 20:52 - Will Green: Push it up scotty
13/07/2019, 20:52 - Greg: im very confused
13/07/2019, 20:52 - Greg: it works perfectly for the folders
13/07/2019, 20:52 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
13/07/2019, 20:53 - Greg: but the trash just yeets itself offscreen when i try and drag it
13/07/2019, 20:53 - Greg: its the same function
13/07/2019, 20:53 - Greg: how can this be
13/07/2019, 20:53 - Will Green: It's not going to get born old?
13/07/2019, 20:53 - Greg: jezzy jez
13/07/2019, 20:54 - Greg: imagine
13/07/2019, 20:54 - Will Green: They have duplicated css
13/07/2019, 20:54 - Will Green: So perhaps you only changed the css for the folder
13/07/2019, 20:54 - Will Green: Remember it needs to be positioned absolutely
13/07/2019, 20:54 - Greg: which bit
13/07/2019, 20:54 - Greg: ive made the wraps absolute
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: Well, just look at both classes
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: And make sure they're the same
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: Folder-wrap, folder and folder-icon
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: And the dame for trash
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: Same*
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Greg: oh do i need to make all 3 absolute
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: Don't think so
13/07/2019, 20:55 - Will Green: Just the parents
13/07/2019, 20:56 - Will Green: If it works for folder without the children being absolute then no
13/07/2019, 20:56 - Greg: the only difference is that trash-wrap has a margin-top
13/07/2019, 20:56 - Greg: ill just get rid of it
13/07/2019, 20:56 - Will Green: Also, does the script look for a specific class?
13/07/2019, 20:56 - Greg: see if towkrs
13/07/2019, 20:56 - Will Green: If so
13/07/2019, 20:56 - Greg: nah

13/07/2019, 20:57 - Will Green: Push away
13/07/2019, 20:57 - Greg: the icons are stacked when the page loads though
13/07/2019, 20:57 - Will Green: Oh

14/07/2019, 18:25 - Greg: because before for some reason the bin was always on top
14/07/2019, 18:25 - Greg: so if you dragged the folder it would just go underneath

14/07/2019, 18:39 - Will Green: don't be a classic dev and accumulate loads of changes locally and then never push them
14/07/2019, 18:39 - Will Green: you don't wanna be that guy
14/07/2019, 18:39 - Will Green: make your own branch and commit frequently

14/07/2019, 18:40 - Greg: im just
14/07/2019, 18:40 - Greg: very lazy
14/07/2019, 18:40 - Will Green: i think it's something like 'git checkout -m branchname'
14/07/2019, 18:40 - Will Green: or some shit
14/07/2019, 18:40 - Will Green: you literally just do that before making changes
14/07/2019, 18:40 - Will Green: that's it
14/07/2019, 18:41 - Greg: i know
14/07/2019, 18:41 - Greg: wuh oh

14/07/2019, 18:50 - Greg: no
14/07/2019, 18:51 - Will Green: Bollocks
14/07/2019, 18:51 - Greg: enough to make you less awkward
14/07/2019, 18:51 - Will Green: Alright I'll have to buy more
14/07/2019, 18:51 - Will Green: I can't drink it remotely unfortunately

14/07/2019, 18:51 - Greg: grab a beer
14/07/2019, 18:51 - Greg: so many options
14/07/2019, 18:51 - Greg: and yet
14/07/2019, 18:52 - Greg: you choose none of them
14/07/2019, 18:54 - Will Green: I cannot
14/07/2019, 18:54 - Will Green: I am with her now

14/07/2019, 18:55 - Greg: to your peepee?
14/07/2019, 18:55 - Greg: thats very considerate
14/07/2019, 18:55 - Greg: run away
14/07/2019, 18:55 - Greg: tell her you got lost
14/07/2019, 18:55 - Greg: skull a beer
14/07/2019, 18:55 - Greg: then call her
15/07/2019, 00:21 - Will Green: Ay
15/07/2019, 00:21 - Will Green: I'm back
15/07/2019, 00:21 - Will Green: What's poppin
15/07/2019, 00:22 - Greg: Stuffs workin good
15/07/2019, 00:22 - Greg: Merge n pull
15/07/2019, 00:22 - Will Green: okay
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Will Green: soon we should stop working on this
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Greg: Check out the f e a t u r e s
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Will Green: and start working on an actual project
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Will Green: because this thing doesn;t actually matter
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Greg: This is an actual project
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Greg: It's all about image
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Will Green: I think we've nailed that already
15/07/2019, 00:23 - Greg: If it means I don't have to use java script I'm happy with a new project
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Will Green: erm
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Greg: Double click on projects
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Will Green: it'll likely be a combination of javascript and python
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Will Green: I suspect
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Greg: That's acceptable
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Will Green: adam and I are going to start working on a recruitment crm/ats for startups
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Will Green: you're welcome to help out if you want
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Greg: Wasn't that beamery
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Will Green: adam will be handling most of the frontend in React
15/07/2019, 00:24 - Will Green: similar to beamery, but not quite the same
15/07/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: beamery was for enterprise customers, not startups
15/07/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: and also they had a very niche focus on scale (because they focussed on huge customers)
15/07/2019, 00:25 - Greg: I mean I know nothing about the big picture
15/07/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: also, they focussed on the early end of recruitment pipeline (like marketing, engagement, etc)
15/07/2019, 00:25 - Greg: But if you want some actual thing made that's fine
15/07/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: we want to focus on the applicant tracking system side and the testing part
15/07/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: i.e. build integrations with tech test platforms
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Will Green: that they use to test devs
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Greg: Yes
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Greg: Ok
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Greg: Neat
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Greg: Cute
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Will Green: https://www.lever.co/ this is the closest competitor
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Will Green: but even they focus on bigger customers
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Will Green: not startup
15/07/2019, 00:26 - Will Green: s
15/07/2019, 00:27 - Greg: Nice
15/07/2019, 00:27 - Greg: I can do stuff poorly and learn something
15/07/2019, 00:27 - Greg: Then you can get Pete to redo it properly
15/07/2019, 00:27 - Will Green: I think Adam will help with the backend to begin with anyway
15/07/2019, 00:27 - Will Green: he wants to use something like firebase
15/07/2019, 00:27 - Will Green: because it's super simple for authentication
15/07/2019, 00:28 - Greg: F u L l s t a C K D e v
15/07/2019, 00:28 - Will Green: but we'll need a database and some sort of API to query
15/07/2019, 00:28 - Will Green: and adam won't wanna do that
15/07/2019, 00:28 - Greg: Ez
15/07/2019, 00:28 - Will Green: Pete can probably create the infrastructure, and then you can build out new features on it
15/07/2019, 00:28 - Will Green: I'd opt to let Pete do the initial architecture, because he's done it before and he knows what scales and what doesn't
15/07/2019, 00:29 - Greg: But I wanted to make a hash of it
15/07/2019, 00:30 - Will Green: excellent
15/07/2019, 00:30 - Will Green: lovely hashy backend
15/07/2019, 00:31 - Greg: Can't get hacked if it doesn't work
15/07/2019, 00:31 - Greg: 👨🏾‍🦲👈🏾
15/07/2019, 00:32 - Will Green: oh shit
15/07/2019, 00:32 - Will Green: now we've got all the coconuts bitch
15/07/2019, 00:36 - Will Green: you've managed to break the start menu
15/07/2019, 00:36 - Will Green: and fuck up the styling so there's scroll bars agan
15/07/2019, 00:36 - Will Green: again*
15/07/2019, 00:37 - Will Green: i'm just going to have to keep cleaning up after you aren't I
15/07/2019, 00:37 - Greg: Yes
15/07/2019, 00:37 - Greg: Why start menu broken
15/07/2019, 00:37 - Greg: Fix
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: fuck me
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: i have no idea how you've managed tha
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: or what the hell the clickable taskbar is
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: but it has made the task bar wider than 100%
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Greg: kek
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: and I think the z-index of the start is behind clickable area so you can't click on it any more
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: i need to go to bed
15/07/2019, 00:43 - Will Green: got work in the morning
15/07/2019, 00:44 - Greg: No

15/07/2019, 13:35 - Will Green: Oh
15/07/2019, 13:35 - Will Green: Because he thinks they're mind blowing
15/07/2019, 13:35 - Will Green: And changed his outlook on what's possible to simulate
15/07/2019, 13:35 - Will Green: And therefore the rest of his life
15/07/2019, 13:36 - Will Green: Through some philosophical way

15/07/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: I wish I could do that
15/07/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: Think of the sheer volume of music I could listen to
15/07/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: My ears would get so big
15/07/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: But they'd be weak
15/07/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: Like my lats
15/07/2019, 17:46 - Greg: Just like all of you
15/07/2019, 17:46 - Greg: You focused on size like a bro
15/07/2019, 17:47 - Greg: Rather than strength like a autistic lifter
15/07/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: I'm such a fucking Chad
15/07/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: You'll be in awe at the size of me
15/07/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: But disappointed by the weight that I can lift
15/07/2019, 17:48 - Greg: You keep saying how big you are
15/07/2019, 17:48 - Greg: But you always look the same to me
15/07/2019, 17:48 - Will Green: It's because you see me fairly consistently
15/07/2019, 17:48 - Greg: Sounds like you're not getting bigger fast enough then
15/07/2019, 17:48 - Will Green: If you hadn't seen me in 6 months
15/07/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: And then saw me
15/07/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: The long slow bulk is the only bulk my man
15/07/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: Or you'll become fat
15/07/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: Like me
15/07/2019, 17:50 - Will Green: Ugh I've finished what I needed to do today

16/07/2019, 17:06 - Greg: Have you not seen the fearless flyers before
16/07/2019, 17:06 - Greg: I don't know how you've avoided them
16/07/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: no clue
16/07/2019, 17:07 - Will Green: to be honest, when I read his CV I thought an interview wasn't even required

16/07/2019, 17:08 - Greg: You should fuck him

18/07/2019, 10:02 - Greg: ye boi
18/07/2019, 10:02 - Greg: I might just use a lil pic for that
18/07/2019, 10:03 - Will Green: yeah I was going to suggest using a bitmap
18/07/2019, 10:03 - Greg: i see
18/07/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: Or maybe an svg
18/07/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: you should sign up for figma
18/07/2019, 10:04 - Will Green: it would be a good skill for you to have
18/07/2019, 10:04 - Greg: Figma nuts
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Greg: I'll give it a go
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Greg: All Linux editors are hot garbage
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: honestly, if a dev knows vaguely how to use Figma I think that increases their odds of getting an entry level job quite a bit
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: yeah
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: figma is just web based
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: which is why it's so good
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Greg: I wish it was an electron application
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: it is on macos
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: and windows
18/07/2019, 10:05 - Will Green: idk if there's a linux client
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Will Green: https://github.com/ChugunovRoman/figma-linux
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Will Green: yep
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Greg: Mmmmm
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Greg: Yup
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Greg: I me a
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Greg: It's not made by figma
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Greg: But by a friendly autist
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Will Green: yeah, I think they list this on their site though
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Will Green: i've seen it before
18/07/2019, 10:06 - Will Green: I think it has an official stamp of approval
18/07/2019, 10:07 - Greg: "yeah good job doing our work for us even though we probably all work on linux machines"
18/07/2019, 10:07 - Greg: classic
18/07/2019, 10:07 - Will Green: nah they're all on macs fam
18/07/2019, 10:07 - Will Green: like every other dev in the world
18/07/2019, 10:07 - Will Green: out of the 40 engineers here I think i've only seen two with linux on an XPS
18/07/2019, 10:08 - Will Green: all of the others have macbook pros
18/07/2019, 10:08 - Greg: i found a great meme somewhere
18/07/2019, 10:09 - Greg: it was some software company that made for win and mac
18/07/2019, 10:09 - Greg: with no linux client
18/07/2019, 10:09 - Greg: even though everyone wanted one
18/07/2019, 10:09 - Greg: and they were showing off some new bit of their software
18/07/2019, 10:09 - Greg: and it was just running in ubuntu
18/07/2019, 10:09 - Greg: every autist was reeing
18/07/2019, 10:09 - Greg: ill see if i can find it

18/07/2019, 10:17 - Greg: No human would ever say that
18/07/2019, 10:18 - Greg: "I love being complained at"
18/07/2019, 10:18 - Greg: Jesus
18/07/2019, 10:18 - Greg: That's just corporatespeak

18/07/2019, 10:19 - Greg: Is he being forced
18/07/2019, 10:19 - Greg: Complaining "about a letter he'd been sent in error"
18/07/2019, 10:20 - Greg: Throw it away you daft cunt and just foget about it
18/07/2019, 10:20 - Greg: What are you learning from this
18/07/2019, 10:20 - Greg: Can I complain to you for the most unworthy things now and you have to be professional
18/07/2019, 10:20 - Greg: Will when I did a shit just now I got shit on my arse and I had to wipe it off
18/07/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: I'm learning that I hate myself
18/07/2019, 10:22 - Greg: "learning"
18/07/2019, 10:22 - Will Green: nice
18/07/2019, 10:22 - Greg: ok kid
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: we were talking about shitting last night
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: and Adam revealed something weird
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Greg: does he sit backwards
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Greg: or like poop into his hand and put it in the sink
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: when he wipes his ass, he's always worried about wiping it up his back to the point where it's visible
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Greg: what
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: so sometimes he looks at his back in the mirror before he leaves the toilet
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: to make sure he hasn't wiped shit up his back
18/07/2019, 10:23 - Greg: he's not a woman he can wipe forwards
18/07/2019, 10:24 - Greg: but also
18/07/2019, 10:24 - Greg: why does he hold the paper all the way up his back
18/07/2019, 10:24 - Will Green: I know
18/07/2019, 10:24 - Will Green: that's exactly what I said
18/07/2019, 10:24 - Greg: that's fucking weird
18/07/2019, 10:24 - Will Green: like I don't understand why he wipes so high up
18/07/2019, 10:24 - Will Green: anyway
18/07/2019, 10:25 - Will Green: we were talking about how some people wipe forward
18/07/2019, 10:25 - Will Green: and it blew his mind and he was like "that makes so much sense"
18/07/2019, 10:25 - Will Green: "there's so much less to wipe it in to if you go forward"
18/07/2019, 10:25 - Greg: que
18/07/2019, 10:25 - Greg: is it like how in space the faster you go the shorter things are
18/07/2019, 10:25 - Will Green: and he was saying that he'd prefer to wipe shit forward on to his balls than up his back because his back is visible/closer to other people
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Greg: what the fuck just stop wiping after you run out of arse
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Will Green: i know
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Will Green: i don't get it
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Will Green: his shits must be so grimey too
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Will Green: since eating properly it only takes me like 2-3 wipes at most
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Greg: jesus
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Will Green: and they're never grim
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Greg: I'd just get a bedet attachment if I was him
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Greg: Bidet
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Will Green: yeah that's why we were talking about it
18/07/2019, 10:26 - Will Green: because he wants to buy one
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Will Green: he also revealed that when he wanks
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Greg: what a freak
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Will Green: he doesn't bust on himself laying down or in to a tissue
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Greg: im going to bring up his weird wiping as soon as I talk to him next
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Will Green: he gets up on to his knees
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Will Green: and busts in a tissue that he's holding
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Will Green: so he like
18/07/2019, 10:27 - Greg: oh fuck I can't wait for the next pubg sesh
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Greg: hey ad I hear you cum and shit weirdly
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Will Green: sits on the end of his bed when he wanks
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Will Green: he never wanks in med
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Will Green: always sat up or kneeling
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Greg: ???
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Will Green: ikr

18/07/2019, 10:28 - Will Green: hahahaha
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Greg: that's so fucking autistic
18/07/2019, 10:28 - Greg: imagine walking in in that
18/07/2019, 10:29 - Greg: Adam kneeling on his bed spunk tissue in hand with a streak of shit all the way up his back
18/07/2019, 10:30 - Will Green: that's what I said to kirby
18/07/2019, 10:30 - Will Green: i said i'd rather walk in on him having sex
18/07/2019, 10:30 - Will Green: than walk in on him busting kneeling on his bed
18/07/2019, 10:30 - Greg: maybe he sexes weirdly too
18/07/2019, 10:30 - Will Green: i don't wanna know
18/07/2019, 10:31 - Will Green: maybe he always gets cum up his back
18/07/2019, 10:31 - Greg: that would be quite the feat
18/07/2019, 10:35 - Greg: shall i create a figma team for ultra
18/07/2019, 10:36 - Greg: wait flip them round
18/07/2019, 10:36 - Greg: you get it

18/07/2019, 12:04 - Will Green: Oh
18/07/2019, 12:05 - Will Green: Sure
18/07/2019, 12:05 - Will Green: I've got one already
18/07/2019, 12:05 - Will Green: But I think it's capped on the free tier
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Greg: what does that mean
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Greg: what are the consequences of this capping
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Will Green: as in
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Will Green: on the free tier
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Will Green: you can only have a certain amount of teams
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Will Green: I think
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Will Green: and I have two teams already
18/07/2019, 12:08 - Will Green: so I'm not sure I can create another
18/07/2019, 12:08 - Will Green: and i'm at work so i'm on my work figma account, so I can't look
18/07/2019, 12:08 - Will Green: so just make one and invite me: williamanthonygreen@gmail.com

18/07/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: and then from like 4-6pm
18/07/2019, 13:08 - Will Green: the rest of the day is meetings, standups, lunch
18/07/2019, 13:09 - Greg: And lots of sprinting
18/07/2019, 13:09 - Greg: Is that why your legs are so big

18/07/2019, 21:40 - Will Green: was that for a gril
18/07/2019, 21:40 - Will Green: ?

18/07/2019, 21:42 - Greg: ceiling types
18/07/2019, 21:51 - Will Green: i'm so confused
18/07/2019, 21:51 - Will Green: what do you mena?
18/07/2019, 21:51 - Will Green: mean*
18/07/2019, 21:53 - Greg: if you have a room that is on the roof floor
18/07/2019, 21:53 - Greg: it can have a slanted ceiling
18/07/2019, 21:53 - Greg: in the shape of the roof
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: I see
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: Let's see pics of this gril
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: I finally have a dev environment
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: I had to return my macbook
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: cause the keyboard was fucked
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: but they gave me a new one
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: but it meant I had to set everything up again
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: it has been so much effort
18/07/2019, 21:56 - Will Green: they also refunded me £100 so I guess it was worth it
18/07/2019, 21:57 - Will Green: and I got a 2019 model, so It'll probably hold its value better than the first one I had
18/07/2019, 21:57 - Greg: its just usual grill
18/07/2019, 21:57 - Greg: do you not have a dev env on your pc
18/07/2019, 21:57 - Greg: and other macbook
18/07/2019, 21:57 - Will Green: oh

18/07/2019, 21:58 - Will Green: yeah but that turns my room in to a sweatbox
18/07/2019, 21:58 - Will Green: i'm working on my laptop in the living room
18/07/2019, 21:58 - Will Green: anyway, right

18/07/2019, 21:58 - Will Green: I've updated the figma team
18/07/2019, 21:58 - Will Green: so it makes sense
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Greg: and
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Greg: some non shitty icons
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Will Green: non shitty icons for what?
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Greg: because ive just resized them in my shitty linux editing software
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Will Green: and I already gave you a paint window
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Greg: 16x16 trash and folder icons
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Greg: oh right
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Greg: i
18/07/2019, 21:59 - Greg: must have missed that
18/07/2019, 22:01 - Greg: do you want to do something with the background
18/07/2019, 22:01 - Greg: cus while its cool its the default 95 colour
18/07/2019, 22:01 - Greg: when you open the page you literally have no idea what it is
18/07/2019, 22:01 - Greg: it just looks like a bad recreation of a windows env
18/07/2019, 22:14 - Will Green: idk really
18/07/2019, 22:14 - Will Green: I sorta like it
18/07/2019, 22:14 - Will Green: it's edgy
18/07/2019, 22:15 - Greg: make a "Ultra Software" for the start menu
18/07/2019, 22:15 - Greg: <Media omitted>
18/07/2019, 22:15 - Greg: like that
18/07/2019, 22:25 - Greg: <Media omitted>

18/07/2019, 22:38 - Greg: do you not?
18/07/2019, 22:51 - Will Green: no
18/07/2019, 22:51 - Will Green: :(
18/07/2019, 22:56 - Will Green: are you free next friday?
18/07/2019, 22:56 - Will Green: we're going to do something for my birthday I think
18/07/2019, 22:56 - Will Green: probably el classico
18/07/2019, 22:56 - Greg: i cant wait
18/07/2019, 22:56 - Greg: to drink too much
18/07/2019, 22:56 - Will Green: me too
18/07/2019, 22:58 - Greg: are you still in the room with adam
18/07/2019, 22:58 - Greg: can you ask him why javascript is so terrible
18/07/2019, 23:05 - Greg: what the fuck
18/07/2019, 23:06 - Greg: ive been trying to make something work for like an hour
18/07/2019, 23:06 - Greg: and nothing was working
18/07/2019, 23:06 - Greg: and i moved a print statement
18/07/2019, 23:06 - Greg: and now it works?
18/07/2019, 23:11 - Will Green: Niamh just called me
18/07/2019, 23:11 - Will Green: On her way to joes
18/07/2019, 23:11 - Will Green: So weird
18/07/2019, 23:12 - Greg: classic
18/07/2019, 23:13 - Will Green: What were you printing
18/07/2019, 23:13 - Will Green: He says he's confused
18/07/2019, 23:14 - Greg: doing console.log() is making something update or something
18/07/2019, 23:14 - Greg: its some async bullshit
18/07/2019, 23:14 - Greg: awful
18/07/2019, 23:41 - Greg: oh no
18/07/2019, 23:41 - Greg: my spaghetti
18/07/2019, 23:42 - Greg: all my chickens are coming home to roost
18/07/2019, 23:42 - Will Green: oh
18/07/2019, 23:42 - Will Green: I see
18/07/2019, 23:49 - Greg: ffs
18/07/2019, 23:49 - Greg: i did it
18/07/2019, 23:50 - Greg: god its such an insignificant thing too
18/07/2019, 23:50 - Greg: it was when you close a window the one below it comes into focus on the taskbar
18/07/2019, 23:51 - Greg: the people will never appreciate my art
18/07/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: god
18/07/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: sketch is still fucking great
18/07/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
18/07/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: look at this beautiful mockup
18/07/2019, 23:51 - Greg: is that a joke
18/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: nope
18/07/2019, 23:52 - Greg: but that looks terrible
18/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: ignore the text
18/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: the fonts are broken
18/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: but other than that, it's decent
18/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: ?
18/07/2019, 23:53 - Will Green: https://www.sketch.com/
18/07/2019, 23:53 - Will Green: it's the best vector based tool out there
18/07/2019, 23:53 - Will Green: it's better than figma
18/07/2019, 23:54 - Will Green: but collaborating in it is shit
18/07/2019, 23:54 - Will Green: so unfortunately I don't get to use it during the day at work
18/07/2019, 23:54 - Will Green: only when I'm working alone at home

18/07/2019, 23:57 - Will Green: I was talking about the design tool
18/07/2019, 23:57 - Greg: oh i see
18/07/2019, 23:57 - Greg: have you got clicked versions of them too
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: make it look like this with those assets
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: they just invert the shadow
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: i.e.
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: they look like the clock
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: not the start menu
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Greg: i know
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Greg: but dont i need another svg for that
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: do that with css
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: no
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: the svgs are just the icons
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Greg: oh right
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: not the buttons
18/07/2019, 23:58 - Greg: i thought it was the whole package
18/07/2019, 23:59 - Will Green: nope
18/07/2019, 23:59 - Greg: thats fine it should be doing that already
18/07/2019, 23:59 - Greg: actually
18/07/2019, 23:59 - Greg: i think its broken at the moment
18/07/2019, 23:59 - Will Green: what other icons did you want?
19/07/2019, 00:01 - Greg: uhh 16x16 folder and trash
19/07/2019, 00:01 - Will Green: can't you just down scale?
19/07/2019, 00:02 - Greg: i can
19/07/2019, 00:02 - Greg: but i am a lazy man

19/07/2019, 00:34 - Will Green: Am in bed
19/07/2019, 00:34 - Will Green: You can fix it in the svg file of you wanna be a hacker
19/07/2019, 00:34 - Will Green: 😎😎
19/07/2019, 00:35 - Greg: BRUH
19/07/2019, 00:35 - Greg: oh
19/07/2019, 00:35 - Greg: i figured it out
19/07/2019, 00:35 - Greg: <Media omitted>
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Greg: x was doin this shit
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Greg: but man knows about his no repeat
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Greg: phew
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Will Green: Nice
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Will Green: It wasn't meant to turn out like that
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Will Green: It's four fs
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Greg: 🐎
19/07/2019, 00:36 - Greg: you big nazi
19/07/2019, 10:36 - Greg: whats the bit that connects github and whatever youre hosting on?
19/07/2019, 10:37 - Will Green: It's netlify
19/07/2019, 10:37 - Will Green: They host too
19/07/2019, 10:38 - Will Green: And provide SSL certs and domains
19/07/2019, 10:38 - Will Green: It's grest
19/07/2019, 10:38 - Will Green: Great*
19/07/2019, 10:38 - Will Green: Never use aws anymore
19/07/2019, 10:38 - Greg: oh noice
19/07/2019, 10:39 - Greg: does it just grab it from git
19/07/2019, 10:39 - Greg: thats so synergising
19/07/2019, 10:39 - Will Green: Yeah, when you set up a new site you just point it to a repo on github, gitlab or bitbucket
19/07/2019, 10:39 - Will Green: Then configure build commands (if you need them)
19/07/2019, 10:39 - Will Green: Obviously if it's just a static site it just serves it
19/07/2019, 10:40 - Will Green: But my website is built on gatsby
19/07/2019, 10:40 - Will Green: And when I linked the repo for that it auto detected it and installed everything automatically
19/07/2019, 10:40 - Will Green: It was beautiful
19/07/2019, 10:40 - Greg: oooof
19/07/2019, 10:40 - Will Green: Try it out with a react app
19/07/2019, 10:40 - Will Green: It'll blow your mind
19/07/2019, 10:41 - Greg: i was thinking
19/07/2019, 10:41 - Greg: the javascript is some tangled nightmare
19/07/2019, 10:41 - Greg: perhaps i should just rewrite it all with react
19/07/2019, 10:41 - Will Green: Ya
19/07/2019, 10:41 - Will Green: Not a bad idea
19/07/2019, 10:43 - Greg: hopefully the fine bros wont come after me
19/07/2019, 10:43 - Will Green: Mr bug eyes will find you
19/07/2019, 10:43 - Will Green: He can see everything
19/07/2019, 10:44 - Greg: god i bet its going to be like
19/07/2019, 10:44 - Greg: python for js
19/07/2019, 10:44 - Greg: instead of having to write some bullshit drag function
19/07/2019, 10:44 - Greg: itll just be like
19/07/2019, 10:44 - Greg: div.dragEnable()
19/07/2019, 10:48 - Will Green: I'm not sure you're ready to experience react
19/07/2019, 10:48 - Will Green: It's even more mental then vanilla js
19/07/2019, 10:48 - Will Green: You're only just scratching the surface friend
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: <Media omitted>
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: read the first bit
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: Ffs
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: Really
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: Why am I doing actual thinking like a fucking and idiot
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: When I could just get a library
19/07/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: read the link I sent
19/07/2019, 10:50 - Greg: I am chill nigga
19/07/2019, 10:50 - Will Green: prepare to experience js, html and css all mangled together
19/07/2019, 10:50 - Will Green: inside eachother
19/07/2019, 10:51 - Greg: What the fuck is this
19/07/2019, 10:51 - Greg: This is horrible
19/07/2019, 10:51 - Greg: Is it actually better
19/07/2019, 10:51 - Greg: Is it worth struggling through
19/07/2019, 10:52 - Will Green: It is if you're building something complex
19/07/2019, 10:52 - Will Green: you haven't even gotten in to routing yet
19/07/2019, 10:52 - Will Green: and state management
19/07/2019, 10:52 - Greg: i don't like this
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: https://redux.js.org/
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Greg: so it may be completely pointless to make it into react
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: it depends how complex you want to make it
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: I think it's fine tbh
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: I wouldn't bother
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: but the app we're working on
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: ( the real app)
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: will be react
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: for sure
19/07/2019, 10:53 - Will Green: in fact, adam has already started it in react
19/07/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: definitely worth learning react though
19/07/2019, 10:54 - Greg: oh no
19/07/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: it's what all the cool kids use
19/07/2019, 10:54 - Will Green: react frontends are pretty much everything these days
19/07/2019, 10:54 - Greg: god I'm just going to be that guy that's used every type of language and is shitty with them all
19/07/2019, 11:00 - Will Green: Sounds like everyone tbh
19/07/2019, 11:48 - Greg: I'm trying to find out if there anything that can make my life easier for js
19/07/2019, 11:48 - Greg: I thought jquery was the boi
19/07/2019, 11:48 - Greg: But
19/07/2019, 11:48 - Greg: No one seems to like it anymore
19/07/2019, 11:48 - Greg: People like vanilla
19/07/2019, 11:48 - Greg: This landscape is scary
19/07/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: yeah nobody uses jquery anymore
19/07/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: unless it's for little hacky things
19/07/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: i have to interview a java engineer... what the fuck do I even do or say
19/07/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: she's been a java dev for like 10 years
19/07/2019, 11:49 - Will Green: "oh yeah, let's get that 23 y/o designer to go talk to her"
19/07/2019, 11:50 - Will Green: "that's very relevant, I'm sure he'll have some very valuable questions to ask her"
19/07/2019, 11:52 - Greg: milk that last day
19/07/2019, 11:52 - Greg: surely it's not just you
19/07/2019, 11:52 - Will Green: Well there's engineers interviewing her as well
19/07/2019, 11:52 - Will Green: But I have a one hour slot with her
19/07/2019, 11:52 - Will Green: On my own
19/07/2019, 11:53 - Greg: Hahahha
19/07/2019, 11:53 - Greg: What
19/07/2019, 11:53 - Greg: Why
19/07/2019, 11:53 - Will Green: God knows
19/07/2019, 11:53 - Greg: _i_ could ask more relevant questions
19/07/2019, 11:53 - Will Green: I can't talk at a senior java engineer for an hour...
19/07/2019, 11:53 - Will Green: Exactly!
19/07/2019, 11:54 - Will Green: They want me to ask her how she works with designers
19/07/2019, 11:54 - Will Green: Ask design related stuff
19/07/2019, 11:54 - Will Green: But I think she'll just be like Oh ffs I don't wanna go through this
19/07/2019, 11:54 - Will Green: Which is totally fair
19/07/2019, 11:54 - Will Green: Maybe I'll just tell her that
19/07/2019, 11:57 - Greg: That'll take like 15 minutes surely
19/07/2019, 11:57 - Greg: "how do you interact with designers at your current job"
19/07/2019, 11:57 - Greg: "how wrll does that go"
19/07/2019, 11:57 - Greg: done
19/07/2019, 11:58 - Greg: and some shitty hypothetical
19/07/2019, 11:58 - Greg: to go through with her
19/07/2019, 11:59 - Will Green: Yeah, I mean I could think of enough to talk about for 30-40 mins
19/07/2019, 11:59 - Will Green: But an hour is just a waste of her time
19/07/2019, 12:10 - Greg: Do you have the power to end it
19/07/2019, 12:11 - Greg: You can't be forced to fill an hour
19/07/2019, 12:11 - Greg: "hot one today isn't it"
19/07/2019, 12:12 - Greg: "have you ever been in a storm?"
19/07/2019, 12:12 - Will Green: A storm of code
19/07/2019, 12:12 - Greg: a storm of interfaces
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: So much gui
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: God
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: I want to stop working
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: And go live in the country somewhere
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: I've decided I'm going to fuck off out of London in a few years
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: Go live in the back ass of nowhere
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: Learn to drive
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: Chill out
19/07/2019, 12:13 - Will Green: Work remotely
19/07/2019, 12:14 - Will Green: Fewer hours

19/07/2019, 12:15 - Will Green: Or buy one of those vans climbers convert in to homes
19/07/2019, 12:15 - Will Green: Then just drive around doing fuck all
19/07/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: Occasionally doing a bit of remote work to pay for fuel for me and my metal companion.
19/07/2019, 12:16 - Will Green: <Media omitted>

19/07/2019, 13:48 - Will Green: let me have a looksie
19/07/2019, 13:49 - Will Green: did you git add .
19/07/2019, 13:49 - Will Green: to add the new files?
19/07/2019, 13:49 - Will Green: try git status locally
19/07/2019, 13:49 - Will Green: I think the files just don't exist

19/07/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: “Hi James,

How are you?

I have a new Product Designer role that I think would be a great for you, within a future UK Unicorn start-up!

The company are a technology and gaming company, who are revolutionising the insurance industry and have the same investors as Spotify and Izettle, whilst being backed by AIG. The company have created an interactive insurance Product that rewards it’s members for everyday activity such as walking or mindfulness. These points can be redeemed in a coin form, earnt through the app, which can be used in Gyms, on Amazon and gaining air miles!

The company, who are already valued in excess of £30million and have raised £10million in funding for their series A, have a plan which will take them to the unicorn stage within 4 years, which is an incredible opportunity to join an already established company at their early stages. This will involve them turning their app into an RPG game, where users can interact with their virtual insurance self!

When would you be free to discuss further?

Thanks,
Zak”

22/07/2019, 09:51 - Will Green: That's the right brand but mine are bigger
22/07/2019, 09:51 - Will Green: Those are Street style wheels but bigger and softer
22/07/2019, 09:51 - Will Green: They'd probably be fine tbh
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Will Green: these are the ones i've got
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Greg: Jesus
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Greg: Oh so yours are over 60?
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Greg: I'm looking at the bones ones
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Greg: But I don't want them huge
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Will Green: they're like convexed
22/07/2019, 09:52 - Greg: Mans gotta pop
22/07/2019, 09:53 - Will Green: yeah I'd get bones ones
22/07/2019, 09:53 - Will Green: you just want them to be a bit bigger than normal street wheels
22/07/2019, 09:53 - Will Green: and a bit softer
22/07/2019, 09:53 - Will Green: you can't pop on those zip zinger ones
22/07/2019, 09:53 - Will Green: they're super soft
22/07/2019, 09:53 - Will Green: and massive
22/07/2019, 09:54 - Greg: Pop doesn't come from the wheel my man
22/07/2019, 09:54 - Greg: It comes from the heart
22/07/2019, 09:54 - Greg: And tail
22/07/2019, 09:54 - Will Green: Good luck with that
22/07/2019, 09:54 - Greg: Pop my heart
22/07/2019, 09:55 - Greg: I was just after a size comparison
22/07/2019, 09:55 - Greg: Cus they do two sizes of them bones ones
22/07/2019, 09:57 - Will Green: Oh
22/07/2019, 09:57 - Will Green: I don't remember what mine were
22/07/2019, 09:57 - Will Green: 52 maybe
22/07/2019, 09:57 - Will Green: I seem to remember that number
22/07/2019, 09:57 - Will Green: Maybe that was the hardness number
22/07/2019, 09:57 - Will Green: 🍆
22/07/2019, 10:34 - Greg: Nice
22/07/2019, 10:35 - Greg: Oh that seems small?
22/07/2019, 10:35 - Greg: I think
22/07/2019, 10:35 - Greg: I'm not sure
22/07/2019, 10:35 - Greg: 52 looks like regular street skate size
22/07/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: I think maybe 54
22/07/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: There's not much difference if I remember
22/07/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: Like they normally range from 48 to 54
22/07/2019, 10:46 - Will Green: If I remember correctly
22/07/2019, 10:46 - Greg: Hmmmmmmm
22/07/2019, 10:47 - Will Green: Google a chart
22/07/2019, 10:47 - Will Green: I remember reading an article about wheel size and softness when I got them
22/07/2019, 10:47 - Will Green: Cause I couldn't decide what was optimal
22/07/2019, 10:47 - Greg: There's some quality charts out there
22/07/2019, 10:48 - Greg: 52 - 56 apparently is the most common
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: I see
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: I think the bones ones I had were 54
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: They were almost the same size as Street wheels
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Will Green: But they were just much softer
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: I might go a bit bigger
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: 56 maybe
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: Wild
22/07/2019, 10:49 - Greg: Fleets a bumpy place
22/07/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: yeah, those zip zinger ones are giant
22/07/2019, 10:56 - Will Green: and super smooooth

22/07/2019, 11:08 - Greg: I'm not sure if I want 56 or 58
22/07/2019, 11:08 - Greg: Hmmm
22/07/2019, 11:08 - Greg: There's probably not much in it
22/07/2019, 11:14 - Will Green: https://youtu.be/36enK0Qslfc

23/07/2019, 16:33 - Greg: I don't think that's how physio works
23/07/2019, 16:33 - Will Green: well, it'll take a few sessions
23/07/2019, 16:33 - Greg: Doesn't it take a while
23/07/2019, 16:33 - Greg: Or is the physio a man
23/07/2019, 16:33 - Greg: A muscle wizard
23/07/2019, 16:33 - Will Green: but at least they'll be able to assess it, tell me what the problem is and what I should be doing
23/07/2019, 16:34 - Greg: "Don't wear those weird shoes you freak"
23/07/2019, 16:34 - Greg: Maybe I'll just do some pull ups
23/07/2019, 16:34 - Greg: The only important part of pull
23/07/2019, 16:34 - Will Green: Nah, I think they'll tell me to wear them more
23/07/2019, 16:34 - Will Green: and stop using my insoles for my arches
23/07/2019, 16:34 - Will Green: I think that might be what's fucking me up

23/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: I don't think it does you any good long term
23/07/2019, 16:35 - Will Green: I think I have even less of an arch now
23/07/2019, 16:37 - Greg: How embarrassing
23/07/2019, 16:37 - Greg: I'm going to laugh at your small arches on Friday

23/07/2019, 16:44 - Will Green: they're very flappy
23/07/2019, 16:44 - Will Green: like flippers
23/07/2019, 16:49 - Will Green: I think that's why i'm quite heavy footed

23/07/2019, 18:06 - Greg: "hi I saw you in tinder and messaged you without matching"
23/07/2019, 18:06 - Greg: "what do you mean that defeats the point of the app?"
23/07/2019, 18:07 - Will Green: I say this a lot

23/07/2019, 18:10 - Greg: suicide joke jar meme
23/07/2019, 18:10 - Will Green: Lazy

23/07/2019, 19:32 - Greg: More like gay in the butt amirite
23/07/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: The physio also showed me why my knee thing has happened
23/07/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: And it was a bit worrying
23/07/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Basically my right leg has more muscle mass than the left
23/07/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: And apparently it's pretty obvious just from looking at it
23/07/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Y I K E S
23/07/2019, 19:34 - Greg: Will "wonky" green

23/07/2019, 19:35 - Will Green: But she was like
23/07/2019, 19:35 - Will Green: "How can you not see the difference between your quads"
23/07/2019, 19:36 - Greg: Maybe you're too dismorphic already
23/07/2019, 19:37 - Greg: Both just look tiny to you
23/07/2019, 19:54 - Will Green: Yeah
23/07/2019, 19:55 - Will Green: I just got home and asked Adam and Kirby if they thing one of my quads is smaller than the other
23/07/2019, 19:55 - Will Green: And Adam said the left is smaller
23/07/2019, 19:55 - Will Green: And Kirby said the right is smaller
23/07/2019, 19:55 - Will Green: So I'm not really sure...
23/07/2019, 19:56 - Greg: I suspect they're both right
23/07/2019, 19:56 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
23/07/2019, 19:56 - Will Green: Actually, I just took that photo
23/07/2019, 19:57 - Will Green: And to me the left is smaller
23/07/2019, 19:57 - Greg: Stage left is bigger I reckon
23/07/2019, 19:57 - Will Green: Yep
23/07/2019, 19:57 - Will Green: That would be what she said
23/07/2019, 19:57 - Will Green: Damn son
23/07/2019, 19:57 - Will Green: Maybe she was right

23/07/2019, 19:58 - Greg: No
23/07/2019, 19:58 - Will Green: I've got to wear this fucking tape on my knee
23/07/2019, 19:58 - Greg: But id trust the opinion of someone that stares at quads all day

25/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: Use git
25/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: Resolve conflicts locally
25/07/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: It's even worse when you're working on a big project with many people making changes
25/07/2019, 23:53 - Will Green: That's why things like react are so popular
25/07/2019, 23:53 - Will Green: You can work on things in isolation
25/07/2019, 23:53 - Will Green: Separate files

26/07/2019, 09:06 - Will Green: he's like a retarded child
26/07/2019, 09:06 - Greg: that has his hands on huge amounts of drugs
26/07/2019, 09:07 - Greg: do you need to review the pull request before I can sort out the conflicts
26/07/2019, 09:07 - Greg: or can I just do it once I've put in the pull
26/07/2019, 09:35 - Greg: 🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷

31/07/2019, 20:37 - Will Green: we wanna start working on our first proper project
31/07/2019, 20:38 - Will Green: so we want you do build a REST API
31/07/2019, 20:38 - Will Green: for the backend
31/07/2019, 20:38 - Will Green: with authentication
31/07/2019, 20:38 - Will Green: and saving user data to a database
31/07/2019, 20:38 - Will Green: I think that'll keep you occupied for a while
31/07/2019, 20:41 - Greg: Oh heck

31/07/2019, 20:50 - Will Green: because just calling them <project_name>-backend is super lame
31/07/2019, 20:50 - Will Green: at iwoca we named them after greek gods
31/07/2019, 20:51 - Will Green: but we can think of something a e s t h e t i c and r e t r o

05/08/2019, 10:20 - Greg: Is that likr
05/08/2019, 10:20 - Greg: Just a page being hosted
05/08/2019, 10:21 - Greg: And flask will replace it when it's actually going
05/08/2019, 10:21 - Greg: Or is that not what we're using flask for
05/08/2019, 14:06 - Will Green: what?
05/08/2019, 14:06 - Will Green: idk what you're talking about
05/08/2019, 14:08 - Greg: <Media omitted>
05/08/2019, 14:09 - Will Green: Oh

05/08/2019, 14:17 - Greg: I may be
05/08/2019, 14:17 - Greg: Perhaps
05/08/2019, 14:31 - Will Green: nice
05/08/2019, 14:46 - Will Green: I got a refund
05/08/2019, 14:46 - Will Green: from kinguin
05/08/2019, 14:46 - Will Green: thankfully
05/08/2019, 14:46 - Will Green: but it has been put on my account
05/08/2019, 14:46 - Will Green: so now I have £5 to spend on a game on Kinguin
05/08/2019, 15:10 - Greg: Sweet
05/08/2019, 15:10 - Greg: You can get scammed again
05/08/2019, 15:25 - Will Green: ikr
05/08/2019, 15:25 - Will Green: excellent
05/08/2019, 17:27 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
05/08/2019, 17:27 - Will Green: how the fuck has someone logged in
05/08/2019, 17:27 - Will Green: I have 2FA on now...
05/08/2019, 17:28 - Greg: kek what
05/08/2019, 17:28 - Greg: that was so qukck
05/08/2019, 17:28 - Will Green: they're a shambles
05/08/2019, 17:28 - Greg: quick
05/08/2019, 17:31 - Greg: <Media omitted>
05/08/2019, 17:32 - Greg: ok i think i can make more sense than earlier
05/08/2019, 17:32 - Greg: basically
05/08/2019, 17:32 - Will Green: tried to reset it
05/08/2019, 17:32 - Will Green: to a generated password
05/08/2019, 17:32 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
05/08/2019, 17:32 - Will Green: my generated password is too strong for them
05/08/2019, 17:32 - Will Green: a maximum of 16 characters
05/08/2019, 17:33 - Greg: as i understand flask its like
05/08/2019, 17:33 - Greg: sort of front end python right?
05/08/2019, 17:33 - Greg: like you can use it for incoming requests
05/08/2019, 17:33 - Greg: but also make it shit out the web pages you want
05/08/2019, 17:33 - Greg: but you had the site hosted on something else
05/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: so thats what im confused about
05/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: was that just a single page being hosted
05/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: and you want to use flask as the actual like
05/08/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: Nah
05/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: going to different pages n shit
05/08/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: Flask is a framework for building APIS with python I think
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: i have no idea what front end is
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: Not my wheelhouse though
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: Frontend is anything in the browser
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: you can build entire websites with flask
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: I didn't know that
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: I don't use it
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: I never have
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: Pete has
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: right
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: ill ask pete what i should be doing that
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: My understanding is it's a python framework
05/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: then*
05/08/2019, 17:36 - Will Green: It isn't like django
05/08/2019, 17:36 - Will Green: As far as I know
05/08/2019, 17:36 - Greg: i think the difference is django is a full stack thing?
05/08/2019, 17:36 - Greg: and flask is like
05/08/2019, 17:36 - Greg: a little bit of it
05/08/2019, 17:36 - Greg: and you choose your other bits to go with it
05/08/2019, 17:37 - Will Green: I thought django was why you're describing flask as
05/08/2019, 17:37 - Will Green: As in, full stack
05/08/2019, 17:37 - Will Green: But I thought flask was purely backend
05/08/2019, 17:37 - Greg: nah you can do stuff like modify html and all that with flask
05/08/2019, 17:38 - Greg: like you can run python instead of javascript
05/08/2019, 17:38 - Greg: if you can figure out a way of doing it
05/08/2019, 17:38 - Will Green: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask
05/08/2019, 17:38 - Will Green: you can't run python in a browser
05/08/2019, 17:39 - Will Green: javascript is the only language that can be interpreted by a browser
05/08/2019, 17:39 - Greg: i know
05/08/2019, 17:39 - Greg: i dont mean
05/08/2019, 17:39 - Greg: literally in its place
05/08/2019, 17:39 - Greg: i mean you can get the same results
05/08/2019, 17:39 - Will Green: as in, shift everything to the backend and just use ajax to update the page content?
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Will Green: maybe? I've never heard of anyone doing that
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Will Green: some things just make sense to do on the frontend
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Will Green: like field validation, for example
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Will Green: you wouldn't want to query a server every time a user exits a field
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Greg: im not saying we should
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Greg: im just saying its possible
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Will Green: sure
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Greg: anyway
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Greg: ive asked pete
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Greg: so
05/08/2019, 17:40 - Will Green: i think most people use flask to make APIs
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Greg: you need not worry young grasshopper
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Will Green: https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/build-simple-restful-api-with-python-and-flask-part-1-fae9ff66a706
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Will Green: also
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Will Green: Mr python
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Greg: i just dont really understand how the pieces fit together
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Will Green: you should use pycharm
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Greg: and what information is going from where to where
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Greg: pycharm is wank
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Greg: i mean
05/08/2019, 17:41 - Greg: its not wank
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Greg: its just big and chunky
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Greg: vscode has a good enough linter
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: everyone I know who is like a legit backend dev fucking loves it
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: them data bros
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: cream over it
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: also check out this horrific song spotify has recommended me
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Greg: maybe it has some quality features
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Greg: that i dont know about
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Greg: you should survey them
05/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: https://open.spotify.com/track/5z2QCd5jLHMsPB2fabJMSu?si=9yyE6RpgSsGr__KyuXDa2w

09/08/2019, 17:33 - Greg: Why you do that you knobber
09/08/2019, 17:33 - Greg: Just say you don't want to see her
09/08/2019, 17:33 - Will Green: The convo fissled out
09/08/2019, 17:33 - Will Green: And I felt bad and didn't know what to say
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: Oh
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: That's not exactly ghosting
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: And she clearly wanted something serious
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: Which is stupid
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: Yeah
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: Because she's moving to Stockholm
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: Dumb bitch
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Will Green: In two weeks
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: Oh right

09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: That's somewhere Scandinavian
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: Well
09/08/2019, 17:34 - Greg: Unless she's double messaged you
09/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: I wouldn't count it as ghosting
09/08/2019, 17:41 - Will Green: She hasn't double messaged
09/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: But I haven't even read hers tbf
09/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: And she did also very explicitly say that she wanted to see me again if we slept together
09/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: Which we did
09/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: Feelsbadman
09/08/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: Probably not going to do anything about it though
09/08/2019, 17:43 - Greg: Of course

09/08/2019, 17:43 - Will Green: What can I say

09/08/2019, 17:47 - Greg: That seems like a fair solution for everyone
09/08/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: 💯
09/08/2019, 17:48 - Greg: Now the real question is
09/08/2019, 17:48 - Greg: Did you sleep with her knowing about her want to see you again clause
09/08/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: Yes
09/08/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: I signed a contract
09/08/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: Once you have something in writing they can't go back on it
09/08/2019, 17:49 - Will Green: She always wants everyone to sign creepy documents

10/08/2019, 10:32 - Greg: I'm confused
10/08/2019, 10:32 - Will Green: Wait what

10/08/2019, 10:36 - Will Green: Did you dig it

13/08/2019, 19:23 - Will Green: Huh
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Will Green: You probably need to pay for gsuite to use a custom domain with it
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Will Green: I have some other hosting
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Will Green: And I just have it forward emails to my Gmail
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Will Green: I only use it for job stuff
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Greg: jazz
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Greg: more like
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Greg: trash
13/08/2019, 19:24 - Greg: i was just going to use it as a regular email address
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Will Green: Yeah you have to pay if you want to use Gmail
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Will Green: With a custom domain
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Will Green: I think
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Greg: oh
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Greg: right
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Greg: well
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Greg: i wasnt going to do that
13/08/2019, 19:25 - Greg: but good to know
13/08/2019, 19:26 - Will Green: Just set up email hosting with whoever you get the domain from
13/08/2019, 19:26 - Will Green: That's easiest
13/08/2019, 19:26 - Will Green: Sometimes it's free
13/08/2019, 19:26 - Will Green: Sometimes it's pence
13/08/2019, 19:26 - Will Green: Forwarding is always free
13/08/2019, 19:26 - Will Green: That's why I do that
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Greg: as in
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Greg: i can just make
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Greg: greg@gregleonard.com
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Will Green: Yeah
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Greg: and forward it on
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Will Green: Yeah
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Greg: whats that thing you use
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Greg: to find domains
13/08/2019, 19:27 - Will Green: Domainr
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Greg: kek
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Will Green: Ironic
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Greg: ez life
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Will Green: I know
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Will Green: Nice
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Will Green: I got quoted £100k for willgreen.com
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Will Green: Cause someone had parked it to be flipped
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Will Green: Cunts
13/08/2019, 19:28 - Will Green: .Co.uk was £3 though
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Greg: kek
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Will Green: And it's not like I operate globally
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Will Green: So... 🤷‍♂
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Greg: im either going co or co.uk
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Greg: co is shorter
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Greg: and looks more cooler
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Will Green: Co.uk has higher conride
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Will Green: Confidence
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Will Green: *
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Greg: ill ride ur con
13/08/2019, 19:29 - Greg: true
13/08/2019, 19:30 - Will Green: I've got a few
13/08/2019, 19:30 - Will Green: They just all forward to the same address
13/08/2019, 19:30 - Will Green: Shotgun approach
13/08/2019, 19:30 - Greg: the classic email approach
13/08/2019, 19:30 - Greg: i like how horrifically slow this is
13/08/2019, 19:30 - Greg: that makes me happy
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Greg: who good
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Greg: £10 a year from google
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Will Green: I use netlify for everything
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Will Green: Bit pricier
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Will Green: For domains
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Will Green: But hosting is free
13/08/2019, 19:31 - Greg: oh
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Greg: that seems handy
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Will Green: I've used namecheap, Google, aws and godaddy in the past
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Will Green: All fine
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Will Green: Namecheap, as the name would suggest, generally tends to be the cheapest
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Greg: if ur a big fan of netlify though
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Greg: i assume its worth it
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Will Green: Netlify is unmatched on hosting
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Will Green: Also free ssl
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Will Green: It's so good
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Greg: oof
13/08/2019, 19:32 - Greg: gunna do it
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Would be happy to pay double to use netlify
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Greg: oh shit
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Greg: it just links to a git repo
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Greg: incredible
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Ya
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Automatic ci too
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Greg: oh
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: It's gr8
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Greg: i have to buy it through someone else?
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Nah
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: You can buy through them
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Oh
13/08/2019, 19:33 - Will Green: Weird
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: Maybe not .co.uk
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: Just buy it from Google or namecheap
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: And change the name servers
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: To use netlify dns
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Will Green: Super easy
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Greg: righto
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Greg: lol what
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Greg: how can it be different prices from different sites
13/08/2019, 19:34 - Greg: i dont understand
13/08/2019, 19:35 - Greg: but its 3.73 cheaper from namecheap
13/08/2019, 19:36 - Will Green: Complicated
13/08/2019, 19:36 - Will Green: Depends on their volume
13/08/2019, 19:36 - Will Green: Lower overheads
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Will Green: Upsell value
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Will Green: Few other factors
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Will Green: Check it's not a first year price
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Will Green: With automatic renewal at a higher rate
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Will Green: That's how they get ya
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Greg: mmmm
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Greg: not i get to guess what a valid username is
13/08/2019, 19:37 - Greg: now*
13/08/2019, 19:38 - Greg: looks like gmail hosting is extra?
13/08/2019, 19:38 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/08/2019, 19:39 - Greg: i love diving into things i dont understand at all
13/08/2019, 19:39 - Will Green: Bruh
13/08/2019, 19:39 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
13/08/2019, 19:40 - Greg: are you from the future
13/08/2019, 19:40 - Greg: thats very swish
13/08/2019, 19:40 - Greg: very oooo
13/08/2019, 19:40 - Greg: very 🥵
13/08/2019, 19:40 - Will Green: 🍑
13/08/2019, 19:41 - Greg: namecheap looks very suspicious
13/08/2019, 19:41 - Greg: i think i trust google more
13/08/2019, 19:41 - Greg: theyre pretty obvious with their pricing and redirecting stuff
13/08/2019, 19:41 - Will Green: I have had issues with namecheap 2fa before
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: And their customer support was mediocre at best
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Greg: i guess its time to go big daddy google
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: Godaddy is alright
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: But they really try to shill you shit all the time
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Will Green: It's kinda annoying
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Greg: bleh
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Greg: google can just have my date
13/08/2019, 19:42 - Greg: data
13/08/2019, 19:43 - Greg: ok so does it go
13/08/2019, 19:43 - Greg: get domain from google
13/08/2019, 19:43 - Greg: point netlify towards it
13/08/2019, 19:43 - Greg: then make the site and push to github which it connected to netlify
13/08/2019, 19:43 - Greg: that seems easy enough
13/08/2019, 21:19 - Greg: senpai uguu
13/08/2019, 21:20 - Greg: i think ive set everything up correctly
13/08/2019, 21:20 - Greg: but im a bit lost on the forwarding
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Greg: like how do i set the user for the domain
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Will Green: You do it in cpanel somewhere
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Will Green: There's like
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Will Green: A gui for it
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Will Green: Depends on the host I think
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Will Green: If you're using netlify
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Will Green: Then I'm not sure
13/08/2019, 21:21 - Will Green: Google netlify email forwarding setup or something
13/08/2019, 21:22 - Greg: oh yeah im confused about that too
13/08/2019, 21:22 - Greg: im not sure if its a google thing or a netlify thing
13/08/2019, 21:22 - Will Green: If you've changed the name server
13/08/2019, 21:22 - Will Green: Then it's a netlify thing
13/08/2019, 21:22 - Greg: righto
13/08/2019, 21:22 - Will Green: Cause that means you're using them as a Dns
13/08/2019, 22:01 - Greg: ffs
13/08/2019, 22:02 - Greg: i think email forwarding only works through google if i use their dns
13/08/2019, 22:03 - Will Green: Nice
13/08/2019, 22:03 - Will Green: Rip
13/08/2019, 22:04 - Greg: i think?
13/08/2019, 22:04 - Greg: or
13/08/2019, 22:04 - Greg: maybe not?
13/08/2019, 22:04 - Greg: i actually have no idea
13/08/2019, 22:05 - Will Green: God knows
13/08/2019, 22:05 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/08/2019, 22:05 - Will Green: I think netlify should be able to do forwarding
13/08/2019, 22:05 - Greg: this is the thing i want to do right?
13/08/2019, 22:05 - Will Green: Yeah that sounds right
13/08/2019, 22:22 - Greg: can you try and send me an email
13/08/2019, 22:23 - Greg: i think ive set it up all right
13/08/2019, 22:23 - Greg: but i tried to send myself an email from the account its redirecting to
13/08/2019, 22:23 - Greg: and that didnt work
13/08/2019, 22:23 - Greg: i suspect ive just done something wrong
13/08/2019, 22:27 - Greg: oh shit son
13/08/2019, 22:27 - Greg: it totally worked
13/08/2019, 22:27 - Greg: i tried it from another email
13/08/2019, 22:27 - Greg: hell yeah
13/08/2019, 22:27 - Will Green: Noice
13/08/2019, 22:27 - Will Green: It only took you the entire evening
13/08/2019, 22:27 - Greg: i feel like thats pretty good time
13/08/2019, 22:28 - Greg: considering i had literally no idea what i was doing at every step
13/08/2019, 22:29 - Will Green: I mean
13/08/2019, 22:29 - Will Green: I thought it would take about 30 mins
13/08/2019, 22:29 - Will Green: But I guess I've don't it before
13/08/2019, 22:29 - Will Green: 🤷‍♂

28/08/2019, 16:53 - Will Green: I probably hit like 40 applications for placements before I got MS
28/08/2019, 16:53 - Will Green: And that was lucky as heck
28/08/2019, 16:53 - Greg: Like 10
28/08/2019, 16:54 - Will Green: Those are rooky numbers in this bracket
28/08/2019, 16:54 - Will Green: You gotta bump them up
28/08/2019, 16:54 - Will Green: Think of it like hinge
28/08/2019, 16:54 - Will Green: You need a big top of the funnel
28/08/2019, 16:54 - Will Green: Open up that funnel lad
28/08/2019, 16:55 - Greg: I keep jumping between just going fuck out and applying for ones I'm not qualified for
28/08/2019, 16:55 - Greg: And being like
28/08/2019, 16:55 - Greg: Shit if they do go for me I have to go fall an interview
28/08/2019, 16:55 - Greg: Fail
28/08/2019, 16:56 - Will Green: You shouldn't be afraid to fail interviews
28/08/2019, 16:56 - Will Green: Interviews are hugely beneficial
28/08/2019, 16:56 - Will Green: Do as many as you can
28/08/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: Even if you don't think you'll get it
28/08/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: They're like mock exams
28/08/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: In fact, the interviews you get for roles that you don't really want are the best ones
28/08/2019, 16:57 - Greg: I mean if someone asked for one I wouldnt turn it down
28/08/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: Because they save you from fucking up the ones for jobs you do actually want
28/08/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: I'm glad I interviewed at IBM before Microsoft
28/08/2019, 16:57 - Will Green: Because if it was the other way around I wouldn't have gotten Microsoft

28/08/2019, 16:58 - Greg: Ffs

28/08/2019, 16:59 - Greg: I'm doing more than I have in like a year
28/08/2019, 16:59 - Greg: I'm not sure
28/08/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: The first one is the worst
28/08/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: But everyone has to do it
28/08/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: No way around it
28/08/2019, 16:59 - Will Green: Unless you're the Zuckerberg type

28/08/2019, 17:01 - Greg: That's a good feature

28/08/2019, 17:15 - Will Green: I think stacking them is a bit too difficult
28/08/2019, 17:15 - Will Green: I think there should be an easier interaction for applying text styles
28/08/2019, 17:15 - Will Green: like you should be able to just select a tone of voice somehow
28/08/2019, 17:15 - Will Green: like 'sarcasm'
28/08/2019, 17:15 - Will Green: and it formats the text
28/08/2019, 17:16 - Will Green: or maybe there's some way to read the content of the message
28/08/2019, 17:16 - Will Green: and infer the tone
28/08/2019, 17:16 - Greg: An excellent idea
28/08/2019, 17:16 - Will Green: and therefor the formatting
28/08/2019, 17:16 - Greg: Get it into captcha
28/08/2019, 17:17 - Greg: Tone of voice of sentences to train the big Google brain
28/08/2019, 17:23 - Will Green: yeah

31/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: its red
31/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: And the salt and pepper shakers are so distasteful
31/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: and all red wine tastes the same
31/08/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: Yeah, but when you rotate the bottle so the label is facing the camera, you expect it to be some weird flex
31/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: true
31/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: she defo turned it before taking the pic
31/08/2019, 17:35 - Greg: i dont like the sad little pile of veg

04/09/2019, 22:05 - Greg: Don't bother growing a tree
04/09/2019, 22:05 - Greg: It's completely the wrong climate

05/09/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: The only reason I'm tempted to get a new ipad is cause they've added a small swipe keyboard that floats on the right when you hold it landscape
05/09/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: And I bet it's fucking great
05/09/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: My gripe with tablets was always text input
05/09/2019, 10:23 - Will Green: But I think swipe may solve that
05/09/2019, 10:24 - Greg: Mans going all media

06/09/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: it's android so you can change literally anything
06/09/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: it's great
06/09/2019, 17:06 - Will Green: need a rad lock screen
06/09/2019, 18:20 - Greg: I already have an android phone though
06/09/2019, 18:27 - Will Green: Oh yeah
06/09/2019, 18:27 - Will Green: Maybe just get one of those switch style controllers to go around it
06/09/2019, 18:27 - Will Green: A dude at work has one and it's pretty cool
06/09/2019, 18:28 - Will Green: But you'd wanna set up some software to switch to when you use it
06/09/2019, 18:28 - Will Green: With a different launcher
06/09/2019, 18:28 - Greg: Mmmm yeah

06/09/2019, 18:31 - Will Green: I haven't charged it since I got it
06/09/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: And it's still on 70%
06/09/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: I think maybe it's because it doesn't have any background services running like a phone does
06/09/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: Or at least not as many
06/09/2019, 18:33 - Greg: <Media omitted>

06/09/2019, 21:13 - Will Green: All have to complete the same contracts
06/09/2019, 21:14 - Will Green: The contracts are to kill different monsters

06/09/2019, 21:14 - Will Green: Shadow of the colossus
06/09/2019, 21:14 - Will Green: But other players are trying to do the same shit
06/09/2019, 21:14 - Will Green: So you have to kill them if they get in the way
06/09/2019, 21:14 - Will Green: Or you can wait till they kill it

10/09/2019, 00:15 - Will Green: People make their own holds and stuff
10/09/2019, 00:15 - Will Green: It's basically just a block of wood with varying bits of other wood on it

10/09/2019, 00:19 - Greg: how are they so expensive

10/09/2019, 00:23 - Will Green: Cymnastic rings
10/09/2019, 00:23 - Will Green: They aren't transferable grip strength for climbing unfortunately
10/09/2019, 00:23 - Will Green: Hang boards are the only way

10/09/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: And it has a clip one side
10/09/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: And some climbing rope to tie it round something
10/09/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: So you can lift weights with it
10/09/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: Or partially hang on it
10/09/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: I don't know anyone who can hang with their entire weight on it though
10/09/2019, 00:25 - Will Green: I don't think even magnus can

11/09/2019, 08:35 - Will Green: Sort of
11/09/2019, 08:35 - Will Green: You need collagen for tendons
11/09/2019, 08:35 - Will Green: Which is a type of protein
11/09/2019, 08:35 - Will Green: Normally from fish
11/09/2019, 08:35 - Will Green: But you can get it in a powder
11/09/2019, 08:36 - Will Green: Climbers normally take it before they climb
11/09/2019, 08:36 - Will Green: Something to do with it shutteling nutrients to the bits surrounding the tendons
11/09/2019, 08:36 - Will Green: I've never taken it for that
11/09/2019, 08:36 - Will Green: But people on reddit rave about it for tendons
11/09/2019, 08:36 - Will Green: I use it for my stretch marks
11/09/2019, 08:37 - Will Green: It's good for your skin and muscles anyway

11/09/2019, 15:35 - Greg: everyone on reddit seems to be saying collagen is just a big scam for anything to do with climbing

12/09/2019, 16:03 - Greg: God he'd lose his shit if he saw Adam
12/09/2019, 16:03 - Will Green: He'd cum instantly
12/09/2019, 16:04 - Greg: Like a gyser
12/09/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: Exactly
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: Like that toothpaste gif
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Greg: Just like that
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Greg: What's the oil that's good for ones joints
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Greg: Not THC 😎
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Greg: Nice
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: Couldn't find the original
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: CBD
12/09/2019, 16:05 - Will Green: Curcumin is good too
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: As are fish oils
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Greg: Nah its like made of fish
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Greg: Yeah
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: Omega 3
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: Or Krill Oil
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Greg: The sequel to omega 3
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Greg: 2
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Greg: Fuck
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: Omega 4
12/09/2019, 16:06 - Will Green: Electric boogaloo
12/09/2019, 16:08 - Greg: Apparently there's an omega 6 and 9 now
12/09/2019, 16:08 - Greg: What a world
12/09/2019, 16:09 - Greg: I'll probably get some 3
12/09/2019, 16:09 - Greg: Seems to be a general rec
12/09/2019, 16:09 - Greg: It's probably just a placebo
12/09/2019, 16:09 - Greg: Which is a very funny word
12/09/2019, 16:13 - Greg: Maybe I should get some of that ashainfjsina
12/09/2019, 16:22 - Greg: Oh no it looks like all supplements are just pointless and nothing is really worth it apart from protein
12/09/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: The only supps worth your time are protein, creatine, beta-alanine, vitamin D (only if you're deficient), ashwaganda and Krill or fish oil
12/09/2019, 17:02 - Will Green: And unless you really want to get stronger, there's no point taking creatine or beta-alanine
12/09/2019, 17:03 - Will Green: They literally just enhance your performance
12/09/2019, 17:44 - Greg: akk the eens
12/09/2019, 17:44 - Greg: i have no great desire to become some hulking beast of man
12/09/2019, 17:44 - Greg: just need those thicc forearms
12/09/2019, 17:46 - Will Green: I'd just have protein and then some sort of fish oil then
12/09/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: Ashwaganda is good for anxiety though
12/09/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: And it can increase your testosterone too
12/09/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: Which means more muscle and less fat
12/09/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: Look at it on examine
12/09/2019, 17:47 - Will Green: And I take vitamin d every day because I spend all day every day sat inside
12/09/2019, 17:48 - Greg: and you just cant get enough D
12/09/2019, 17:48 - Greg: where do you bulk buy your supps
12/09/2019, 17:48 - Greg: bulkpowders
12/09/2019, 17:48 - Greg: ?
12/09/2019, 17:51 - Will Green: what sort of supps?
12/09/2019, 17:52 - Will Green: I get my protein from Form Nutrition because I use plant based stuff now... Whey seems to fuck with my stomach.
12/09/2019, 17:52 - Will Green: Other than that, I get creatine from Amazon from Reflex Nutrition (it's the cheapest one that comes in a tub instead of a bag, which I find way more convenient because creatine lasts for ages)
12/09/2019, 17:52 - Will Green: and I get ashwaganda from bulkpowders because it's one of the only places that sells the right type of it
12/09/2019, 17:53 - Will Green: and Vitamin D I get from Amazon
12/09/2019, 17:53 - Will Green: I use a spray because it's easier and it has better absorption
12/09/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: My PTs photo on WhatsApp is terrifying
12/09/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: <Media omitted>

12/09/2019, 20:08 - Will Green: Interesting

12/09/2019, 20:10 - Will Green: Unless it's on unreal or something
12/09/2019, 20:10 - Will Green: It's unity
12/09/2019, 20:13 - Greg: does that have a nice ez drop in multiplayer option
12/09/2019, 20:13 - Will Green: Pretty much
12/09/2019, 20:15 - Greg: ill probably torrent it
12/09/2019, 20:15 - Will Green: Handle all the networking for you
12/09/2019, 20:15 - Greg: i doubt itll be popular enough to crack
12/09/2019, 20:16 - Will Green: Why didn't I think of that
12/09/2019, 20:16 - Will Green: Until it has multiplayer
12/09/2019, 20:16 - Will Green: May as well torrent
12/09/2019, 20:33 - Greg: torrent ur life
12/09/2019, 20:37 - Will Green: It's single player after all

12/09/2019, 20:39 - Greg: couldnt have done better myself
12/09/2019, 23:01 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
12/09/2019, 23:50 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
12/09/2019, 23:51 - Greg: 🌝
12/09/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: Too real
12/09/2019, 23:51 - Greg: how can you take a picture like that and not want to lose weight
12/09/2019, 23:51 - Greg: i just dont understand
12/09/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: God knows
12/09/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: She looks like a blimp
12/09/2019, 23:54 - Greg: maybe she is a blimp
12/09/2019, 23:56 - Will Green: I won't let her for away with me
13/09/2019, 00:03 - Greg: fly?
13/09/2019, 07:51 - Will Green: Yeah
13/09/2019, 09:57 - Greg: I've come around slightly to that plant turnover don't
13/09/2019, 09:57 - Greg: Song
13/09/2019, 10:29 - Greg: I keep reading stuff on how I should probably do some stretching for climbing
13/09/2019, 10:29 - Greg: God I'm so unflexible it's painful
13/09/2019, 10:30 - Greg: Why can't I be a rubber jointed freak like you
13/09/2019, 10:58 - Will Green: bendy boi
13/09/2019, 10:58 - Will Green: aint i
13/09/2019, 10:58 - Will Green: it certainly is a massive help climbing
13/09/2019, 10:59 - Will Green: climbing is all about a combination of strength to weight ration, grip strength, flexibility and technique
13/09/2019, 10:59 - Will Green: you should definitely stretch
13/09/2019, 10:59 - Will Green: foam roll too
13/09/2019, 11:00 - Will Green: if you've got a tennis ball or something you can use that
13/09/2019, 11:00 - Will Green: it helps so much with tendon soreness
13/09/2019, 11:00 - Will Green: I have a ball that I roll my forearms on after climbing and it helps so much
13/09/2019, 11:02 - Will Green: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3oNppLLSFtfP5yQH2TZ1CP?si=e7FK6-ttThmf3biRkTlwcw
13/09/2019, 11:02 - Will Green: enjoy
13/09/2019, 13:54 - Greg: <Media omitted>
13/09/2019, 13:55 - Greg: This is some guys "off day" workout on r/climbharder
13/09/2019, 13:55 - Greg: It's insane
13/09/2019, 14:04 - Will Green: That's bullshit
13/09/2019, 14:04 - Will Green: That's so much volume
13/09/2019, 14:04 - Will Green: It's pointless
13/09/2019, 14:05 - Will Green: He's also training stuff he doesn't need to train
13/09/2019, 14:05 - Will Green: And planking is pointless
13/09/2019, 14:11 - Greg: Yeah I thought it seemed
13/09/2019, 14:11 - Greg: Dumb
13/09/2019, 14:11 - Greg: I'm just trying to figure out stuff that's actually worth doing at home
13/09/2019, 14:11 - Greg: I'm pretty bored of just excersising for the sake of exercise
13/09/2019, 14:12 - Greg: So far I've got the weighted pull ups and stretching
13/09/2019, 14:14 - Will Green: rhys says don't do any finger stuff yet because you'll just injure yourself
13/09/2019, 14:15 - Will Green: stick to chin ups, pull ups and deadhangs (a bar, not a finger board)
13/09/2019, 14:15 - Will Green: then do leg/knee raises for core
13/09/2019, 14:15 - Will Green: crunches too
13/09/2019, 14:22 - Greg: Thank u big man rhys
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Greg: Okay cool sounds good
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Will Green: i'd probably do pull ups until you're fatigued
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Will Green: then hang as long as possible
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Will Green: then have a rest
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Will Green: and go again
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Will Green: until you have to switch to chin ups
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Will Green: then do the same
13/09/2019, 14:23 - Will Green: sort of like bodyweight drop sets
13/09/2019, 14:24 - Will Green: same with leg/knee raises. Start with leg raises, go to failure, switch to knee raises, then switch to single knee raises after that, then just hang
13/09/2019, 14:26 - Greg: Noice
13/09/2019, 14:26 - Greg: I'm into that
13/09/2019, 14:26 - Greg: Next time you see me I'll be able to crush cans with my wings
13/09/2019, 14:26 - Will Green: nice
13/09/2019, 14:40 - Greg: i mean not tomorrow
13/09/2019, 14:40 - Greg: your cans are safe
13/09/2019, 14:40 - Greg: but the time after
13/09/2019, 14:58 - Will Green: ah
13/09/2019, 14:58 - Will Green: okay
13/09/2019, 14:58 - Will Green: I won't get my can hopes up then
13/09/2019, 14:58 - Will Green: you fucking weirdo
13/09/2019, 15:12 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
13/09/2019, 15:12 - Will Green: his status fucking killed me
13/09/2019, 15:15 - Greg: Did he actually use arch
13/09/2019, 15:15 - Greg: Does *
13/09/2019, 15:15 - Greg: That's a hell of a last name
13/09/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: Ikr
13/09/2019, 15:23 - Will Green: Idk I think he's just memeing
13/09/2019, 15:58 - Greg: Oh what a poser
13/09/2019, 15:59 - Greg: Are you allowed to use your own os?
13/09/2019, 16:00 - Greg: Also have you got any hot joint recovery tips
13/09/2019, 16:28 - Will Green: If my joints hurt straight after exercise I ice them
13/09/2019, 16:29 - Will Green: Especially tendons
13/09/2019, 16:29 - Will Green: Yeah
13/09/2019, 16:30 - Greg: Hmm
13/09/2019, 16:31 - Greg: It's like the inside of my elbows
13/09/2019, 16:31 - Greg: Nice you should use TempleOS
13/09/2019, 16:32 - Will Green: Yeah that's your tricep insertion in your elbow
13/09/2019, 16:32 - Will Green: Ice it
13/09/2019, 16:32 - Will Green: Also get a tennis ball and push your arm down on it on a desk where it hurts
13/09/2019, 16:32 - Will Green: And roll it around
13/09/2019, 16:32 - Will Green: Helps
13/09/2019, 16:32 - Greg: How do I push it down with the inside of my arm
13/09/2019, 16:32 - Greg: I'd have to be like
13/09/2019, 16:33 - Greg: Hanging like a bat
13/09/2019, 16:33 - Greg: Ice it is
13/09/2019, 16:42 - Will Green: you use your other arm
13/09/2019, 16:42 - Will Green: on top of that arm
13/09/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: put the inside of your left elbow on the ball while it's on a table
13/09/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: then push down with your right hand on the other side of your elbow
13/09/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: and move it around
13/09/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: you're basically just pushing the knots out and getting more blood in to the muscle
13/09/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: don't ice it after you do that though
13/09/2019, 16:43 - Will Green: ice it after exercise if it feels inflamed
13/09/2019, 16:44 - Will Green: rolling a ball on it is the same as doing exercise basically
13/09/2019, 16:44 - Will Green: you work the muscle
13/09/2019, 16:44 - Will Green: and exercising it will help in small amounts
13/09/2019, 16:53 - Greg: lame
13/09/2019, 16:53 - Greg: i want to do stuff
13/09/2019, 16:53 - Greg: but i dont wanna still be fucked on sunday
13/09/2019, 16:53 - Greg: i guess i can do core that doesnt involve hanging
13/09/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: Still two days
13/09/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: That's fine
13/09/2019, 16:58 - Will Green: I'm doing pull today

13/09/2019, 18:29 - Greg: Just like the entire industry
13/09/2019, 18:29 - Greg: How would you use protein powder in a way that doesn't build muscle
13/09/2019, 18:30 - Greg: How to use protein powder the easiest way tutorial

20/09/2019, 14:44 - Will Green: for a whole day
20/09/2019, 14:44 - Will Green: or I could get the train to somewhere

25/09/2019, 17:35 - Greg: whos job it is?
25/09/2019, 17:35 - Greg: to put ram into dims?
25/09/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: it doesn't actually say that it'll be installed by an expert
25/09/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: it just says that it won't be if you don't pay for it
25/09/2019, 17:35 - Greg: wow hang on here
25/09/2019, 17:35 - Will Green: Yeah, obviously it's Mr RAM
25/09/2019, 17:35 - Greg: is it professional or expert?

25/09/2019, 17:37 - Will Green: so I guess if you don't pay £120 then just some man does it
25/09/2019, 17:38 - Greg: oh

18/11/2019, 14:54 - Will Green: They're still a fairly small indie band though
18/11/2019, 14:55 - Will Green: A bit like the arctic monkeys

20/11/2019, 13:13 - Will Green: Where is this?
20/11/2019, 13:14 - Will Green: Surprisingly good form
20/11/2019, 13:30 - Greg: Arch
20/11/2019, 13:35 - Greg: He's not too bad
20/11/2019, 13:35 - Greg: A lot of bicep
20/11/2019, 13:35 - Greg: But I did the same when I was new
20/11/2019, 14:21 - Will Green: Yeah
20/11/2019, 14:22 - Will Green: What grades you climbing now?
20/11/2019, 14:22 - Greg: I could do most of the v3s fairly comfortably
20/11/2019, 14:22 - Greg: The fishy bois
20/11/2019, 14:22 - Greg: The salmons
20/11/2019, 14:24 - Will Green: Noice
20/11/2019, 14:24 - Will Green: Get on them blues son
20/11/2019, 14:25 - Greg: I reckoned there were a few I could have done
20/11/2019, 14:25 - Greg: But I didn't want to go too ham
20/11/2019, 14:27 - Will Green: Sometimes you come across a blue at the arch that's soooo easy
20/11/2019, 14:27 - Will Green: the setting is so inconsistent
20/11/2019, 14:28 - Greg: Yeah I found that
20/11/2019, 14:28 - Greg: Some salmons I just sailed up
20/11/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: Sometimes you'll find a v0 tiger
20/11/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: and it'll be like
20/11/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: borderline impossible
20/11/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: setting routes is very hard though I guess
20/11/2019, 14:28 - Will Green: think it's harder to set than it is to climb
20/11/2019, 14:29 - Will Green: the setters get paid a fair bit
20/11/2019, 14:29 - Will Green: think it's quite a skill
20/11/2019, 14:30 - Greg: Yeah I can imagine
20/11/2019, 14:31 - Greg: I'd love to see you climb now
20/11/2019, 14:31 - Greg: I bet you're so heavy
20/11/2019, 14:31 - Will Green: I'm looking forward to going back soon
20/11/2019, 14:31 - Will Green: I'm not that heavy
20/11/2019, 14:32 - Will Green: The lowest I weighed when I was skinny was about 71.5kg
20/11/2019, 14:32 - Will Green: and I stayed at 73kg for most of the time
20/11/2019, 14:32 - Will Green: and now I'm about 79kg
20/11/2019, 14:32 - Will Green: so basically 1 stone heavier
20/11/2019, 14:33 - Greg: The floor will explode with chalk when you land
20/11/2019, 14:33 - Will Green: but I can still do the same amount of pull ups
20/11/2019, 14:33 - Will Green: so I think my strength should be vaguely proportionate to my weight
20/11/2019, 14:33 - Will Green: my grip won't be as good though
20/11/2019, 14:33 - Will Green: I think I'll be better on some moves, better with jugs
20/11/2019, 14:33 - Will Green: but crimps will just end me
20/11/2019, 14:34 - Greg: Yeah you'll be good on the meathead routes
20/11/2019, 14:35 - Will Green: Yeah
20/11/2019, 14:35 - Will Green: I'll be fucking shit on slabs
20/11/2019, 14:35 - Will Green: I won't trust my feet anymore
20/11/2019, 14:35 - Will Green: holding the extra weight
20/11/2019, 14:35 - Will Green: I'll fear faceplanting
20/11/2019, 14:38 - Greg: Damn son
20/11/2019, 14:38 - Greg: You've already got the fear
20/11/2019, 14:38 - Greg: And youre not even there
20/11/2019, 14:38 - Greg: You wanna go this weekend? I've got nothing on
20/11/2019, 14:41 - Greg: The dude on the train next to me is furiously checking his watch and phone
20/11/2019, 14:41 - Greg: Cus the trains 2 minutes late leaving
20/11/2019, 14:41 - Greg: It's hilarious
20/11/2019, 15:16 - Will Green: Yeah don't think I have anything planned

20/11/2019, 15:21 - Will Green: he isn't even that senior
20/11/2019, 15:21 - Will Green: it's the most money I've ever heard anybody earn ever

21/11/2019, 16:10 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
21/11/2019, 16:10 - Will Green: so veganism does actually include lifestyle stuff outside of diet by definition?

21/11/2019, 16:10 - Greg: Yeah
21/11/2019, 16:10 - Will Green: they don't eat food that has been stored for long periods or processed by machines or some shit

21/11/2019, 16:10 - Greg: I'm surprised you don't know this
21/11/2019, 16:10 - Will Green: so veganism is insane
21/11/2019, 16:11 - Will Green: and plant-based is also insane
21/11/2019, 16:11 - Will Green: I mean, I knew veganism was weird
21/11/2019, 16:11 - Will Green: but like
21/11/2019, 16:11 - Greg: Processed by machines?
21/11/2019, 16:11 - Greg: Like

21/11/2019, 16:12 - Will Green: not really, no
21/11/2019, 16:12 - Will Green: I eat meat pretty much every meal
21/11/2019, 16:12 - Greg: Oh right
21/11/2019, 16:12 - Will Green: which is pretty bad
21/11/2019, 16:12 - Greg: Tofu isn't bad
21/11/2019, 16:12 - Greg: If you cook it so it has actual flavour
21/11/2019, 16:12 - Will Green: ya boi will just eat beans and lentils
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Greg: It's just blobs of meat like matter
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Will Green: what is tofu?
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Will Green: also, is quorn beef any good?
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Will Green: I see
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Greg: Soy milk curds
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Greg: But
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Greg: It's like blobs of chicken
21/11/2019, 16:13 - Greg: Probably the closest meat
21/11/2019, 16:14 - Greg: Yeah the quorn beef is fine
21/11/2019, 16:14 - Greg: Bit less flavour
21/11/2019, 16:14 - Greg: But if you're making chilli or something it won't make much difference
21/11/2019, 16:14 - Greg: But idk if you want to do it properly
21/11/2019, 16:14 - Greg: Just find meals that don't need meat
21/11/2019, 16:15 - Will Green: wait, tofu is soy milk curds?
21/11/2019, 16:15 - Greg: Ye

21/11/2019, 16:15 - Greg: Eh
21/11/2019, 16:15 - Greg: It doesn't need to cook
21/11/2019, 16:15 - Will Green: weird
21/11/2019, 16:15 - Greg: It's just proteins and matter
21/11/2019, 16:16 - Greg: You can eat all the quorn stuff "raw"
21/11/2019, 16:16 - Will Green: what is quorn?
21/11/2019, 16:16 - Greg: A brand
21/11/2019, 16:16 - Will Green: oh
21/11/2019, 16:16 - Will Green: wow I'm so naive to all this sht
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Greg: You have such weird gaps in your knowledge
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Greg: It always takes me by surprise
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: I think my problem is that
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: i just latch on to something
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: get obsessed with it
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: learn lots
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: then move on to something else
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: I don't really have general knowledge
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Greg: I mean
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Will Green: just weirdly specific knowledge about some things
21/11/2019, 16:17 - Greg: I also do that
21/11/2019, 16:18 - Greg: I thought that was normal
21/11/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: but I think I just disregard other shit
21/11/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: if I think it isn't worth my time
21/11/2019, 16:18 - Greg: Hyper autism focus

21/11/2019, 16:18 - Will Green: maybe I am a bit more OCD than you

21/11/2019, 16:40 - Greg: look awful
21/11/2019, 16:40 - Greg: just whip out that magic wand
21/11/2019, 16:41 - Will Green: don't have photoshop on this machine
21/11/2019, 16:41 - Will Green: in fact
21/11/2019, 16:41 - Will Green: I don't have any raster graphics software on any of my machines anymore
21/11/2019, 16:41 - Will Green: vectors are the future
21/11/2019, 16:41 - Greg: he'll yeah brother
21/11/2019, 16:41 - Will Green: gimme that bean vector
21/11/2019, 16:41 - Greg: i cant wait until everything is vectorised
21/11/2019, 16:42 - Greg: when will cameras take vectorised photos?
21/11/2019, 16:42 - Greg: then we can make them as big as they need ot be
21/11/2019, 16:46 - Will Green: i think that's actually impossible?
21/11/2019, 16:47 - Will Green: maybe
21/11/2019, 16:47 - Will Green: idk
21/11/2019, 16:47 - Will Green: https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/39422/is-vector-photography-possible
21/11/2019, 16:47 - Will Green: interesting
21/11/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: "We could theoretically make a vector format that maps every single pixel, but then we'd have a raster image that couldn't scale any better than a normal raster image."
21/11/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: if you can get a computer to describe the image in more detail than a photo
21/11/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: then yes
21/11/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: so I guess AI will get there at some point
21/11/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: but the photo won't be "real" at that point
21/11/2019, 16:48 - Will Green: it will be embellished by a computer
21/11/2019, 16:49 - Greg: so
21/11/2019, 16:49 - Greg: basically no
21/11/2019, 16:49 - Greg: at least you now have that bit of specific knowledge
21/11/2019, 16:50 - Will Green: mhm
21/11/2019, 16:50 - Will Green: i'm not sure what a camera is tho
21/11/2019, 17:01 - Greg: its like
21/11/2019, 17:01 - Greg: imagine you close your hand and grab a load of light
21/11/2019, 17:01 - Greg: if you could open your hand
21/11/2019, 17:01 - Greg: and look at that light
21/11/2019, 17:01 - Greg: thats a camera
21/11/2019, 17:04 - Will Green: Ahh ok
21/11/2019, 17:04 - Will Green: Makes sense
21/11/2019, 17:04 - Greg: see
21/11/2019, 17:05 - Greg: now we know
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/wework-lays-off-2400-employees.html
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: I wonder if jess or holly have been let go
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Greg: kek
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Greg: theyll never be able to let enough people go
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Greg: do they both work there?
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Greg: i didnt know that
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: Yeah
21/11/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: I think it's the first wave of many redundancies
21/11/2019, 18:20 - Greg: you mean until its just the CEO
21/11/2019, 18:20 - Greg: and he sells the company for £1
21/11/2019, 18:21 - Greg: theres no way theyre gunna flip it around right
21/11/2019, 18:21 - Greg: theyre taking biblical losses
21/11/2019, 18:21 - Greg: full bull market
21/11/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: they fired the CEO
21/11/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: now the Softbank CEO is the CEO
21/11/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: they purchased the remaining stake
21/11/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: and now they have control of the entire company
21/11/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: I think they could turn it around
21/11/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: but it will require more than cutting 10% of their work force
21/11/2019, 18:22 - Greg: but bruh
21/11/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: they'll just try to liquidate a load of their assets
21/11/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: and reduce overheads
21/11/2019, 18:23 - Greg: what if they cut your banana water every morning
21/11/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: :(
21/11/2019, 18:23 - Will Green: I don't work in a wework anymore thankfully

22/11/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: How is that physically possible
22/11/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: It looks lovely or she's just walking around with her arms

22/11/2019, 18:26 - Greg: i dont want to see you without a pump
22/11/2019, 18:31 - Will Green: I'm going to train legs
22/11/2019, 18:31 - Will Green: To avoid climbing being shit
22/11/2019, 18:31 - Greg: yeah true you barely need legs
22/11/2019, 18:31 - Greg: great idea
22/11/2019, 18:31 - Greg: nice one will
22/11/2019, 18:31 - Will Green: It looks like she's casually walking around with her arms in her normal habitat
22/11/2019, 18:31 - Will Green: Well it's better than completely frying my back and arms
22/11/2019, 18:32 - Greg: why dont you
22/11/2019, 18:32 - Greg: not to the gym the day before you go climbing
22/11/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: I would do push, but I did that yesterday
22/11/2019, 18:32 - Will Green: Gainz
22/11/2019, 18:32 - Greg: god

22/11/2019, 18:35 - Greg: are you going to wank in the gym
22/11/2019, 18:35 - Will Green: Fluff up the muscles
22/11/2019, 18:35 - Will Green: You know
22/11/2019, 18:35 - Will Green: Confuse them a bit
22/11/2019, 18:36 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
22/11/2019, 18:36 - Greg: oh yes of course now i understand
22/11/2019, 18:36 - Will Green: Confusion = gains
22/11/2019, 19:03 - Greg: Of course
22/11/2019, 19:03 - Greg: If your muscles don't know what they're doing they'll get more biggerer
22/11/2019, 19:06 - Will Green: Yeah exactly
22/11/2019, 19:06 - Will Green: so if I got more skin, then I could never do a bad thing in my life
22/11/2019, 19:07 - Will Green: Maybe I've never done a bad thing because I have a lot of skin
22/11/2019, 19:10 - Greg: So what you're saying is go even further, get even more skin
22/11/2019, 19:46 - Greg: Just heading down to the tube

16/12/2019, 22:14 - Will Green: ☹
16/12/2019, 22:14 - Greg: bro
17/12/2019, 11:17 - Greg: When do you find out if you've got sleep autism or not ?
17/12/2019, 11:17 - Will Green: Probably a few weeks
17/12/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: January 8th is my pre op
17/12/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: Guess I'll get the results then
17/12/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: Will also get results from the allergy test I did
17/12/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: I am SO fucking tired
17/12/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: I think I got like
17/12/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: 4 hours sleep
17/12/2019, 11:18 - Will Green: Awful.
17/12/2019, 11:25 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
17/12/2019, 11:28 - Greg: Didn't you go to bed at like 10
17/12/2019, 11:29 - Greg: Bruh your depth is disappointing
18/12/2019, 00:27 - Greg: <Media omitted>
18/12/2019, 14:47 - Greg: Bruh I am making something
18/12/2019, 14:47 - Greg: And i need your guiding voice of obvious usability
18/12/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: Sure
18/12/2019, 15:44 - Will Green: What's the craic
18/12/2019, 17:34 - Greg: okay so basically all the colour pickers on linux are garbage
18/12/2019, 17:34 - Greg: theyre either stuffed with features that i dont want
18/12/2019, 17:34 - Greg: or badly designed messes
18/12/2019, 17:34 - Greg: so i wanted to make something simple
18/12/2019, 17:35 - Greg: basically i want to be able to pick colours off my screen and use them again later
18/12/2019, 17:35 - Greg: so im just thinking of a little tool that lets you pick a colour
18/12/2019, 17:35 - Greg: and then saves it in a pallet that you can fill
18/12/2019, 17:35 - Greg: <Media omitted>
18/12/2019, 17:35 - Greg: so imagine like that
18/12/2019, 17:36 - Greg: but im not sure how to make it work
18/12/2019, 17:37 - Greg: do i want a set number of spaces for colours like the paint swatch
18/12/2019, 17:37 - Greg: <Media omitted>
18/12/2019, 17:37 - Greg: like that
18/12/2019, 17:37 - Greg: where the number of spaces are already defined and you cant choose any more
18/12/2019, 17:37 - Greg: or one where you can have it so they add to the gui as you pick them out
18/12/2019, 17:37 - Greg: and you can remove any you dont need
18/12/2019, 17:38 - Greg: i want to make it so you can click on the colour and itll put it in your clipboard
18/12/2019, 17:38 - Greg: and you can remove them from the pallet also somehow
18/12/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: There's a macos called contrast that's like this
18/12/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: It's a menu bar app
18/12/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: That's well designed
18/12/2019, 17:42 - Will Green: I'd copy that to an extent
18/12/2019, 17:43 - Will Green: Why not just render one but retain the history and let them step back through the history
18/12/2019, 17:43 - Will Green: Like a clipboard
18/12/2019, 17:43 - Will Green: Using a key combo or something
18/12/2019, 17:43 - Will Green: Or you can have a GUI for people who don't use key shortcuts
18/12/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: Because realistically you don't need to see them all
18/12/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: Normal use case is probably most recent or one or two ago
18/12/2019, 17:45 - Will Green: Maybe can just survive with active and undo
18/12/2019, 17:56 - Greg: explain undo
18/12/2019, 17:56 - Greg: yeah im not sure
18/12/2019, 17:56 - Greg: im making it for myself really
18/12/2019, 17:56 - Greg: i think id like to have them all avaliable to just pick off anytime
18/12/2019, 17:56 - Greg: rather than cycling through
18/12/2019, 17:57 - Greg: i might just leave the text off so it can be smaller
18/12/2019, 17:57 - Greg: or have an autistic mode and a gui mode
18/12/2019, 17:58 - Greg: i dunno though
18/12/2019, 17:59 - Greg: whats a reasonable amount of colours someone would actually use to design something
18/12/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: Do that
18/12/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: And then
18/12/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: Have the number of previous colours available be dynamic based on how many you use over time
18/12/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: Data informed UI is peng
18/12/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: The future
18/12/2019, 18:17 - Will Green: 😎
18/12/2019, 18:17 - Greg: yeah that was my original vision
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Greg: id have like a little + button or something
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Greg: that lets you add in a new colour
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Greg: and it put in a new ui element
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: Or just have them time out
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: I.e. Have a max of 8
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: But don't show the empty slots
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: And over time have them time out
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: So sometimes there's 3
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: Sometimes there's 6
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Will Green: Sometimes there's 1
18/12/2019, 18:18 - Greg: eh i think people would get annoyed by seemingly randomly disappearing colours
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Greg: i might just let people make as many as they want
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Greg: and itll stack in a column of like 8 or so in a row
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Greg: its linux
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Will Green: Not if you get the timer right
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Greg: people are probably less retarded
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Will Green: Like 2 hours or something
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Will Green: Less?
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Will Green: OK buddy
18/12/2019, 18:19 - Greg: i didnt say autistic
18/12/2019, 18:20 - Greg: okay
18/12/2019, 18:20 - Greg: so that can be my direction
18/12/2019, 18:20 - Greg: itll be informed by the data
18/12/2019, 18:20 - Greg: like a good little future ui
18/12/2019, 18:20 - Greg: im not sure what to make it look like though
18/12/2019, 18:20 - Greg: any obvious layout pop into your head?
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Greg: thats aesthetic
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: Look at that contrast app
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Greg: theyre bad at screenshots
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Greg: its very annoying to find pictures of it
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: Well, principles dictate that the active colour be top left
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: And then the history naturally should cascade left to right
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Greg: but there isnt really an "active" colour
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: From.the right of the active colour
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Greg: im just going to fill it left to right
18/12/2019, 18:21 - Will Green: Aren't you going to add the hex to the clipboard?
18/12/2019, 18:22 - Will Green: If so then there is an active colour
18/12/2019, 18:22 - Greg: hmmmm
18/12/2019, 18:22 - Greg: true
18/12/2019, 18:22 - Greg: but that might get a bit wishy washy
18/12/2019, 18:23 - Greg: like
18/12/2019, 18:23 - Greg: they might copy something else
18/12/2019, 18:23 - Greg: i guess its more like a "last used"
18/12/2019, 18:23 - Greg: or most recent
18/12/2019, 18:25 - Will Green: Yeah
18/12/2019, 18:25 - Will Green: Either way it should be top left of the layout
18/12/2019, 18:25 - Greg: maybe?
18/12/2019, 18:25 - Greg: but that might get annoying
18/12/2019, 18:26 - Greg: if youre using like 4 colours
18/12/2019, 18:26 - Greg: and you cycle between them all
18/12/2019, 18:26 - Greg: if youre going to try and click on one and theyve all moved positions every time
18/12/2019, 18:26 - Greg: that would bug me
18/12/2019, 19:07 - Greg: oh shit son
18/12/2019, 19:08 - Greg: apple uses X for its displays
18/12/2019, 19:08 - Greg: so i reckon it should run on macs too
18/12/2019, 19:08 - Greg: thank u *nix very cool
18/12/2019, 19:08 - Will Green: Dang son
18/12/2019, 19:08 - Will Green: Macos is basically Linux
18/12/2019, 19:08 - Greg: yeah but i thought apple might have created their own display software
18/12/2019, 19:09 - Greg: X is ancient
18/12/2019, 19:09 - Greg: but nope
18/12/2019, 19:43 - Greg: are there any weird colour thingies that people widely use apart from RGB and hex
18/12/2019, 19:55 - Will Green: Cmyk
18/12/2019, 19:55 - Will Green: Rgba
18/12/2019, 21:35 - Greg: E?

24/12/2019, 23:48 - Greg: bro
24/12/2019, 23:48 - Greg: im trying to find the name of a colour thing
24/12/2019, 23:49 - Greg: but i have no idea how to find it
24/12/2019, 23:49 - Will Green: ?
24/12/2019, 23:49 - Greg: basically
24/12/2019, 23:49 - Greg: its RGB
24/12/2019, 23:49 - Greg: but each value is multiplied by 256
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Will Green: Web safe?
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Greg: <Media omitted>
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Greg: so you get something like the top line
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Greg: instead of regular ol rgb
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Will Green: I don't know
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Greg: damnit william
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Will Green: Can't say I've ever seen that tbh
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Will Green: Is that 8 bit colour?
24/12/2019, 23:50 - Greg: i didnt know such a thing existed
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: It's basically lower res
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: I think 8 bit is the same as web safe
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Greg: is RGB confined to ints?
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: But I've never really known what it is
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: Ye
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: I think so
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: Wait
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: Decimal?
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: 👀
24/12/2019, 23:51 - Will Green: Idk
24/12/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: Google friend

24/12/2019, 23:52 - Greg: wait
24/12/2019, 23:52 - Greg: do you mean google RGB with floats
24/12/2019, 23:52 - Greg: or what the mystery colour numbers are
24/12/2019, 23:52 - Will Green: This
24/12/2019, 23:53 - Greg: oh
24/12/2019, 23:53 - Greg: so the actual function man page gives this as an answer
24/12/2019, 23:53 - Greg: <Media omitted>
24/12/2019, 23:53 - Greg: but it doesnt say _why_
24/12/2019, 23:57 - Will Green: Peteyboi will know
24/12/2019, 23:57 - Greg: idk
24/12/2019, 23:57 - Greg: i dont think he deals with colours
24/12/2019, 23:57 - Greg: i doubt he has much knowledge of the area
24/12/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: But he knows lots about data types
24/12/2019, 23:58 - Will Green: The reason they store it like that will probably be some really technical efficiency shit

25/12/2019, 17:34 - Greg: I didn't consider trains

25/12/2019, 17:39 - Will Green: I guess north London somewhere
25/12/2019, 17:39 - Will Green: Cause his rents are like near Watford or something I think

26/12/2019, 11:53 - Greg: i can only imagine how tasty and fresh their food is to have to advertise like that
26/12/2019, 11:53 - Will Green: Unprecedented
26/12/2019, 11:53 - Greg: its so unsual
26/12/2019, 11:54 - Greg: there is no precedent

26/12/2019, 14:52 - Greg: Bruh time to do a podcast
26/12/2019, 14:54 - Will Green: I dislike the arm placement
26/12/2019, 14:54 - Will Green: That'll piss you off fam
26/12/2019, 14:54 - Will Green: God look at your autistic little draws for circuits and shit
26/12/2019, 14:54 - Will Green: Bet that xlr mic gunna sound dope
26/12/2019, 15:01 - Greg: What's wrong with the arm placement?
26/12/2019, 15:04 - Will Green: I have it lower than a right angle normally
26/12/2019, 15:04 - Will Green: Which you can't do with it above your monitor like that
26/12/2019, 15:04 - Will Green: It needs to be to the side
26/12/2019, 15:04 - Will Green: The mic doesn't point down does it?
26/12/2019, 15:04 - Will Green: The pick up is on one side
26/12/2019, 15:04 - Will Green: So the side of the mic needs to be parallel with your face
26/12/2019, 15:38 - Greg: oh right i see what you mean
26/12/2019, 15:38 - Greg: that was just where it is when i took the picture
26/12/2019, 15:38 - Greg: i havent sorted the placement
26/12/2019, 15:50 - Greg: <Media omitted>
26/12/2019, 15:50 - Greg: This seems to work well
26/12/2019, 15:51 - Will Green: is it not always in your way?
26/12/2019, 15:51 - Will Green: I have it on the side
26/12/2019, 15:51 - Will Green: so that it's easy to whip out of the way
26/12/2019, 15:51 - Will Green: and the arm is below my eye line
26/12/2019, 15:51 - Will Green: so it never occludes the montiors
26/12/2019, 15:52 - Will Green: monitors *
26/12/2019, 15:52 - Greg: what do you mean
26/12/2019, 15:52 - Greg: its off to the side of my monitor when im sitting
26/12/2019, 15:52 - Greg: <Media omitted>
26/12/2019, 15:53 - Greg: <Media omitted>
26/12/2019, 15:53 - Greg: and can be pushed away like so
26/12/2019, 15:54 - Greg: i havent really got space on either side for it to be on
26/12/2019, 15:56 - Will Green: it's in your field of vision though
26/12/2019, 15:56 - Will Green: if it was at the side and angled down
26/12/2019, 15:56 - Will Green: it would always be below your eyes
26/12/2019, 15:57 - Will Green: you'd have to have the mic to the side rather than down
26/12/2019, 15:57 - Greg: I see
26/12/2019, 15:57 - Will Green: <Media omitted>
26/12/2019, 15:58 - Will Green: so when your mouth is in front of it
26/12/2019, 15:58 - Will Green: you can see your monitor
26/12/2019, 15:58 - Greg: I haven't got space on the side though
26/12/2019, 15:58 - Will Green: and the arm is out of the way to the side
26/12/2019, 15:58 - Will Green: this guy has it on the front of his desk
26/12/2019, 15:58 - Will Green: i guess that works too
26/12/2019, 15:58 - Will Green: but idk
26/12/2019, 16:03 - Greg: idk
26/12/2019, 16:03 - Greg: it doesnt bug me being there at the moment
26/12/2019, 16:03 - Greg: if it really annoying me ill figure out how to put it somewhere else
26/12/2019, 16:03 - Greg: but for now its fine
26/12/2019, 16:03 - Will Green: i shouldn't have pointed it out
26/12/2019, 16:04 - Will Green: cause now it's going to annoy the shit out of you

26/12/2019, 16:05 - Greg: this is very important
26/12/2019, 16:06 - Greg: it will enable her to look past the fact that youve got a group chat where all people do is post poo
26/12/2019, 16:11 - Will Green: I was thinking I'd open with the poo chat tbh
26/12/2019, 16:11 - Greg: <Media omitted>
