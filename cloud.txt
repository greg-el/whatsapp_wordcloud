halloween you go as cayman dayman* i go as nightman nigga where am i gunna get a yellow suit and top hat amazon i've thought of so many things and this seems the most feasible how how is a bright yellow suit and hat the most feasible what the heck else have you been coming up with because you have to think of characters not outfits like people we actually like and can get away with dressing up as consume more pop culture go dressed as aaron i'll be gabe ffs i have too much chin and nobody would get it what about lance and aaron you go as aaron that would never work u fool maybe go as green cunt i can be papa franku i was gunna go as man spider but i feel like it would be a lost reference nah that's more of a marvel reference if you want a lost reference go as hurley i don't even know who that is so you want to buy my old wheels they're too bouncy to land anything fine for cruising and not looking "lame" nigga i'm in no position to buy anything also too bouncy to land anything isn't a great selling point just thought i'd be honest i got some cheap hard wheels and i've actually managed to land a few things without rolling incredibly fast or losing the board under my feet as it bounces gunna try finally land a strawberry milkshake later good luck bruh what level of hard are those wheels what did you land i landed this weird dismount finger flip thing i found on utube you know that guy who was skating around last time we went there he kept like ollie, jumping off the board, flipping it and jumping back on? it's like that but it's impossible to do if you've got soft wheels cause it bounces all over the place and the wheels are 99a so they're like wheels for actually doing tricks horrible to cruise on eh u just said they were good for cruising i'm talking about the ones i that i just got not the soft ones the soft ones are great for cruising they're like 40a though oh right i glossed over that completely does it roll like mine now not quite that bad somewhere in the middle sounds pretty gooood yeah it's decent i wish i had the balls to commit to stuf think i could probably land a varial can you ollie yet yeah not while rolling get drunk and skate then youll be fearless that sounds like a terrible idea nah what could go wrong i might try and get that 5050 down on that bit how hard can it be what bit? oh i know what you mean its even got the babies first grind bit on it huh you'll need some wax lol i took the risers off my trucks and it's so much easier to maintain balance on two wheels interesting i wouldnt have thought it would make much difference i read something about having low trucks and it said that it lowers your centre of gravity which makes it easier to land tricks and to manual its only like a cm difference at most though quarter of an inch oh wow apparently it's why some pros have low trucks even less i can't see that it would make any difference at our level thouggh nah just learn the stuff without worryig about it then i guess if you had like 50mm wheels like all the people on sls have and like no risers and super low trucks the deck would be really low to the ground if it is easier youll be mad sick on lows tru i got a pair of those painkiller socks on ebay (new) for like £8 and i haven't had bruised ankles since only knees and elbows link me up bruh ill get some eventually also i dunno if ill come down for ahlloween unless i get a job in like the next week im polishing up my cv some more to put it on reed but well see they're gone these are the closest to them http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/footprint-insoles-painkillers-shin-ankle-guard-skateboard-socks-uk-4-8-/262648493562?hash=item3d2711f5fa:g:uvkaaosw4shx2n2l they're the high ones though probably better tbh gnarly good! get applying for shit but even if i do its on a monday night unless the night out for it isnt then yeah greg there's the wonderful thing when you work called holiday and you can take it whenever your heart desires assuming your manager isn't a cunt and you don't work in like a coffee shop big assumption nah im aiming to get some nice soul sucking job somewhere maybe but im coming down in november to see mouse outfit with liv n she wants to go skate in the skatepark too which im up for sweet sounds good im not sure how much it is to get in or anything still kinda dumb that you gotta pay but bleh i wanna go at some point the place my parents are moving to has a free skatepark and it actually looks half decent theres one in my town too it would be good if i was better but its more bmx/scooter focused which is super lame everything is a bit too big to practice on that looks pretty dire but its got a flat box yeah it has a flat box and a rail and a smallish ramp that looks rank every time ive gone past it its just full of scooter kids its got some weird ramp placement as well it looks like a load of ramps have been put there just to be stored my sides thats the sort of people that are usually there man that was sick i know dude why even manual on a scooter?

i think thats only if youve set up a ramdisk im figuring out what new shit i want anyway so ill probably just leave it in for now might be a good way to test though e in a bit? just heading back aeiou boiii oi kek what where did you find that on some spotify playlist nice was it plantion gospel plantation* techno feelsbadman i want one of these so bad might sell my keyboard and the machine and get one everything in ableton maps to it 1:1, so you never have to touch the software you can do everything with the hardware shut the lid of your laptop and just play stuff on it do it buy it you rich boi but it's £1,000 fuk sublet your room for a month and sleep in the cupboard tru or i could just live on the streets forever and have unlimited money but no teeth hodl buy fomo i think ive got all my pc bits and i have the money to buy them now and i can being an adult is rad oh hell ye lemme know how it goes and i might buy all the same shit you getting an nvme sad? /ssd* one of the pcie ones im thinking about it i sorta need to upgrade my storage in general ive got a 128 ssd and a 1tb hdd so an nvme would mean my ssd would be for just fast storage which may be kinda handy but i can get like a 500gb ssd for not that much money ram is so fucking expensive though i see i really wanna just ditch hdds get an nvme as a boot drive like 250gb then 500gb ssd maybe could always keep the hdd i have for porn and music im getting deep into ryzen ram shit what ram are you going for? apparently i need a b-die ram kit i have no idea yet wut b-die is apparently some new kind of die that ram uses and it plays well with ryzen cpus because they are more sensitive to changes in clock speed of ram which apparently a b-die makes almost non existant i'm just furiously browsing reddit until i find a good combo i can just steal sounds awful please send me a link to the cpu mobo ram combo you go for so i don't have to deal with this bullshit of course massa does massa want anything else while i dance and jive for maasa yes free money and for you to get a job in london urgh fine i'll do my cv you slavedriver excellent this is so fucking confusing apparently ryzens dont like odd timing memory oh boy good job you're getting new ram or you'd be up the creek without a paddle and what a nightmare that would be its worse than i thought all my clock speeds are absolute garbage two of my sticks of ram dont even report the manufacturer take them out honestly you'll be better off all of them run on system memory god damn son the memory costs more than the cpu this is some bullshit okay i think this is a good price/performance for ryzen wait no alright memory is 10 quid more but is probably the best without getting into 200_ 200+ also im not convinved an nvme ssd is worth the money over just getting a huge ssd instead i thought the read/write speeds were waaaay better? like 4x better £400 punds wow 4x i s pretty good... but ive been reading up and unless the rest of your system is just hanging around waiting for stuff to load it wont make any difference over an ssd basically the main argument is that in real life situations it ends up being 1/2 seconds faster loading something and the money you spend on a nvme could have bought you loads more space in an ssd if youve got the money then buy it son not if i buy a push how much is a 128 nvme? i just want it as my boot drive for that sweet 1 second boot time buy a push you wot then i'll use an ssd for my games and a hdd for everything else that ableton thing i linked you to looks like around 50 oh wow that's not as much as i thought it would be interesting does that mobo support nvme? erm probably lol i just tried to log onto my bank to do money things and my fucking hsbc code thing has run out of battery fucking 1000/10 there hsbc just fucking ditch them they are utter wank i switched to metro and i hold most of my cash with them they have a decent mobile app and you can just log in with touch id or whatever hmmmm neat ill have a look into it and then i use monzo for everything else (get paid in to it, manage money through it) also i think im going to buy some pricey ram the internet has told me its a good idea the only thing i use metro for now is saving money because i don't trust monzo enough for them to have my cash i think that sounds sensible me too my build is at 469 at the moment half is ram also you can just do the current account switching service go on and they'll automatically move everything over from your hsbc to it without you having to do anything oh shit it's a scheme that the government enforces every bank to have to promote competition and make it easier for consumers to switch you can do the same with monzo look at first direct too they're meant to be pretty good and offer some sort of bonus for switching think it's like £100 or something ill check it out actually also im going to buy shit now prime it get it tomorrow fuggin christmas boiii duh theres like fuck all metros around me but first direct apparently use hsbc which is super tight oh shit son lol go in to hsbc and switch to first direct the first direct website is like all black and white i feel like im a fucking dog looking at it i thought my monitor broke yeah, their branding is pretty edgy lol thats the switching stuff oh they must've changed it why's it all black and white? hahaha i love that amazon and fitbit didn't give them permission to desaturate their logos and polaroid missing instantly bad meme :( me rn wow bruh install thug online oh shit okay will do link me up just google it you lazy boi i see you on your pc i am indeed we're playing br if you're on?

yeah save exit interesting i was unaware of this your fucking exit time is already reduced by a third set up an autohotkey script to enter :x with a single key stroke boom youll be flying escape :x the true escape why do you need to press escape its not like you navigate in insert mode is it will? is it? why would i be using vim if i wasn't editing a file? i'd just cat it nigga watt insert mode is inserting text rather than it reading input as vim commands as in when you press i and start typing yeah, i mean the only time i'm likely to exit is when i'm typing because otherwise i wouldn't be in vim editing a file a normal use case is open vim insert exit lol who uses vim for that use nano you fukkin tryhard < use nano literally nothing wrong with nano if i want to edit a single line ezpz anyone who says otherwise is probably running freebsd sure but it's still nano that isn't an argument will memes aren't arguments i had to go all the way back to my fucking office because i left my keys on my desk aaagh bruh that's long as fuck imagine how healthy you'll be after all that walking though you'll be able to eat 2 tins of tuna tonight i got an uber hahahaha so only one tin of tuna 4 me damn goodbye tuna protein gains e later?

wait you have a magazine on your motherboard? no im not a fucking autist ahhhhh fuck that would have resulted in endless fun and abuse i know now i am sad every time i think of tryhard gamer motherboards i always think of that its just so fucking stupid in every way what if it gets caught in customs i bet it just creates heat too nah the bullets absorb the heat then they get fired away ah yeah of course how naive of me so its actually really efficent its not a too autistic looking board apart from the aregeebee and the steel armour still cant put any of it in though cus you cant plug an am2 cpu into am4 so theyre both useless oh, that actually looks okay apart from the bit where it says tomahawk like a missile ohhhh so you haven't got the cpu yet?

ye just eatin dope will be back in 10 nice the sun days are making moves theres some restaurant in fleet huh new album? damn i can't believe he just nutted all over the table like that yeah new album i was going to say earlier there's some restaurant on fleet with a sandwich board outside advertising stuff and theyve used comedy chevrons as bulletpoints and when i saw it i just started reading it like a greentext fuck sake wow ur broken > be me have you listened to angel dust sorry angel du$t i have not e? ye will be on in 10 e tonight? most likely i need to use your brain anyway i don't know how to do good css oh really? fire away it's mostly just arranging things but i'll see what i need from you later dope is the root html page just traditionally called index yeah, that's what the browser is built to look at first when it's directed to a directory so sub pages should be in subfolders with indexes what form does the index take i.e. greg.com/test would be test/index.html form? ah i was thinking like numbers as an index no wait what so you just call everything index? you just call the root html file index.html but sub pages if it's static you just put a file called index in a subfokder yeah, that's the easiest way of doing it folder or you can do other fancy stuff just make a subdirectory and put index.html in that i see doesn't that get confusing when you're editing multiple of them when you use a framework or something, ultimately it's being compiled down to that structure or do you not really do that or for react or whatever it's just some giant bundle like having 5 tabs just called index.html it's normally prefixed by the parent directory so you know which file it is i seeeeee eh what's that thing it makes a web page into a single js file? you can fuck around with http to change root file names but it's not worth the effort imo and the css is called main along with the js what's the name of that dude from star trek that covered queen and a bunch of other shit william shatner? that's the one isn't it incredible it's almost unbelievable like i'm really not sure if it's ironic or not i have no idea it's an enigma you should learn some mobo it's easy af what is it? vulf were doing some live thing for their new song i see 🐦🗿 🗿 have you gone home yet?

so you get a white dude during the night so you can always spot him yeah increase contrast maximise accessibility nice you should patent this we can give people the opportunity to sign up to enjoy the google life experience and stuff can't be stolen during the day so that makes sense too i mean you'd need some kind of geofence right including shock collar at least during the day of course i think they should be dressed as gnomes or maybe gnoblins no gnot a gnome and gnot a gnoblin a gnelf? gnot a gnelf a gngoogle a gni no a gbasketballamerican of course gni🅱🅱a g🅱i🅱🅱🅰 gno🅱lin hahahaha e? just got home you still on? ye uktg next halloween we should go as vic and vin partners in real-estate partners in life is that when charlie says he's made himself perfectly redundant yeah i'll regress e? ye in a min wut n u t n i that girl messaged me as if nothing had happened i'm gnot a gnoblin about some other random stuff i'm a gnut lel wut ye i just replied saying "you stood me up... we were meant to go for dinner tonight..." maybe she reads dates m/d/y hahahaha she got an interdenominational discrepancy ooh naughty that's insane she replied saying she had a really busy day at work, blah blah think i'm going to sack her off probably a good idea will the spooky spectre spooky? like some kind of luminous spirit her imagine if you'd spent your time making that game and it ended up being that game hahaha dude you've gotta get an amex the amount of points i'm accumulating is insane i have like £100 worth of amazon credit from a few months it's madness also, just discovered that registering to vote boosts your credit score (???) how get amex lol wut who isnt registered to vote me apparently cause i moved 1 sec click apply now get a gold card because it's free for a year and if you don't use it you can cancel it after that just put literally everything through it if you spend £2k on it in the first 3 months (which you probably will if you stick everything on it) you get 20k points which is like £200 oh, also, i was going to tell you last night but totally forgot you should call virgin media because they called me saying i was eligibile for an upgrade (???) and i was like "well i'm not using all of my data right now, i think i actually may be paying too much" and then they were like, "well actually you're on 30gb for £20pcm now but we can upgrade you to 40gb for £13pcm" so i just cut £7 off my monthly phone bill and got 10gb more data lol wut ikr madness oh i got a text from virgin saying that i think they tried to call me but i never answered because i just assumed they were gunna try and make me send more money well ring them on 789 from your mobile and tell them that your friend recently got a call about an upgrade and switched plan to the above and say that they text you saying you're eligible yeah, they started by trying to give me some phone on a 24 month contract and trying to increase my rate and i was like 'i just bought an iphone xs and i only use half the data i'm paying for with you, so i'd like to reduce my monthly fee' could literally hear her thinking "ffs my boss is going to hate me" poor person thats so cheap £13 a month for 40gb i dont even know how much i use i dont think i get to 20 yeah exactly i was the same i asked if i could pay less and get less and she said you can get 10gb for £10 or 40gb for £13 what a choice so i asked her for my average data usage per month and she said 11gb with a peak of 35gb so i was like "40gb pls" i mean even if you didnt its £3 for 30gb yeah exactly it's madness i honestly don't understand it i mean the extra cost to them is probably almost nothing and they get to keep you as a happy ol customer so i guess its worth it for them ye but they just reduced my annual bill by like £100 plebs fucking degenerates also i found something out the other day one of the white dudes in death grips drums for a math rock band and i think hes actually mental yeah he's pretty good math rock drumming is madness just ordered one of those home hubs was on sale for black friday 👌 so i now have a spare google home mini if you wanna buy it if not, i'll probably just stick it in the kitchen i dont even know what id do with one you could set it up to control the volume of your pc and move that fucking contraption you've created ok google volume 40 no ok google volume 40 it just works true i mean i actually don't know what's happened to it recently because it was absolutely fine before maybe it's just because it's in a bigger room or maybe my voice has changed a bit and i need to retrain it wtf visual studio code is great its like atom if it wasnt wank or like sublime if it wasnt aids it's amazing right the extensions are incredible so many the c++ and python ones are like amazing it works the same as pycharm but it doesnt eat up all my fucking ram and cpu i havent installed the ubuntu subsystem yet but can you use it as a terminal in it yep get zsh too ohmyzsh after you've installed linux subsystem oh no another shell it's just really customizable and you can use it in vsc and hyper i see is it gunna moon wut is monzo yeah hmmm worth throwing something in i think but not loads i'd put in like £500 tops but depends what your other savings are like i mean i've been living at home for ages i need to get the fucking monzo app working first i had to send them a message cus it's wank oh really why's that? i've heard it's shit on android it wants me to enter my mobile number and put in a code it sends me but every time i do it it auto reads the code from the text and just says "something went wrong contact someone of this continues" super helpful error i see that's lame have you ever looked up the lyrics for hacker it's a 5/7 nope link my meme streme upboi >stay surrounded by long hairs you'll catch a jpeg to the head you're an intern at wikilinks wiki leaks yes right, do you wanna do something this weekend? idk what's on but i'm sure there's shit we can do could go flight club or junkyard golf or a gig or to play pool you got work on sunday? what is flight club and junkyard golf ill hunt around bandsintown yes this might be aight vulf esque funk on fridayt hey they sound p good bit sad sad? yeah, some of it is a bit sad vibey u no btw, grant just showed me something that i can't believe i've never done before take off your space bar key and flip it put it back it's so much better it's ridiculous why would it ever be the other way oh yeah i dont think theyll play much sad stuff live tho my thumb no longer sits on the corner althought it looked like theyre supporting someone yeah, that's what i thought which is kinda wank who are they supporting? let's have a look together tonight will be back from gym at like 8 its this time to flip this mofo where the fuck do i put the little piece of metal im bamboozled wait wut ,      ??? oh errrr mine isn't like that so i'm not sure oh no its fine you can still do it it's just different you put one side in first i have no idea what that entails google it nice ive only gone and fucking done it my son my wpm is now 50x'd it's for playing fames mainly games* when your hand rests on wasd but it also helps typing too tbh it feels waaaay nicer its so ergonomic all my thumb strain has disintergrated excellent fuck wrong one e! ?* out at the mo when you gunna be back? now cool just invited you :( it says you're on discord i am confoosd left pc to restart am pooping i think it's a no wiper i won't be long i've got an idea for something that you can make and use it to learn javascript pottentially go on my son soooo basically when i use a browser i tend to have tabs categorised in to different things i.e. i have one load of tabs for work related shit and then a bunch of tabs for other stuff so it would be great to have some way to group them in the nav at the top and to expand/collapse the groups onetab does this pretty well, but it basically closes and re-opens them which is annoying interesting i'll give it a go 👌 i think you can do it as a chrome extension hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm it might actually be possible maybe why wouldn't it be? i dont really use chrome but if you havent touched a tab in a while in firefox it always loads it up again i didnt know if it would be the same sort of thing/if you could stop it doing that i should probably use chrome first yeah use chrome for it will be easier to make better extension support and docs for devs love me some docs gotta love api docs fuck sake i keep sending it to you because the other one is basically your name as wlel does the picture of the gnoblin not give it away? no what you and the group have the same picture no we don't i have a normal picture of me the group is the fucking gnome are you saying your gnot a gnome? i'm gnot a gnelf i'm gnot a gnloblin and i'm gnot a gnome e?

do their own brand emojis look so fucking weird got it running boi o shit just eating gimmi 10 btw, you should setup an account with wealthsimple it's great is that that shares thing nah that's freetrade wealthsimple is like a managed account you put money in and they automatically invest it well, it's managed by a human so not automatic, but they do it for you if you get what i mean an actual human? don't they use any a l g o r i t h e m s probably one of those human algorithms bruh i dont think what you want is possible without some awful hacky solution chrome has some beastly resource management even if theyre shared out between supertabs like you want itll still just background whatever ones you arent using i mean i think you can turn that off but it might fuck ur pc up 2000% ram usage hmmm i think it should work in theory i think you'd have to do some hack shit use a page file or something or write some better way to cache the only thing ive thought of is just like save the actual pages on your pc then it just loads them locally when you open it e? just eating yeah that's good e shortly ok that seems more doable some will be fucky though probably maybe ill just make a whitelist of ones that always reload themselves like you dont want a local version of whatsapp loading itll just shit itself what does the ui look like? i is on where u at son o shit son i'm out now i shall be back at some point at the moment there's no ui i mean there's a single button that saves a page in a sort of ok way i see i see my whole body aches fml how was sushane huh susan? suwick seshwan warsaw? wausn sashwan? i have no idea what you're talking about your pt oh you mean warpus i was getting so close you were getting there gradually human machine learning it was good wasn't too awful tbh he made me run for about 20 mins and then do some weights that was pretty much it other than taking my height weighing me, etc. how tall are you 6"3? nope 6' dead on ooooo without shoes duh obviously lmfao e? yes you working today? i am hahahaha oh no amazing isn't it dw i sent him in the right direction "use nodejs you faggot" vsc my dude and learn css that's the answer vcs? visual studio code? also what the heck is jquery whenever i seadch for a thing for java script someone gives an answer in jquery and someone always reply with a solution in vanilla js that's no longer it was big ages ago it's just a library for javascript basically an extension to vanilla js with some built in stuff people tend to avoid it these days es6 is decent enough and using vanilla js is generally more performant well i thought it was like a module to do extra stuff but there always seems to be a way to do it in vanilla so i just stuck to that who knows oh i was going to ask a thing i think comes user ux so for the tab thing if you have a bunch of tabs open already what's a simple way to organise them into the groups you want the only thing i can think of is just a giant list with checkboxes but that'll look shit or a thing to add the current tab to a group but if you want to do loads it'll take ages there isn't really anything you can't do in vanilla js that you an in jquery i think? that might be wrong but as far as i know it just introduces another layer to simplify some fundamental stuff errr let me have a think in chrome you can shift click tabs to select multiple tabs so maybe do that and have a keyboard shortcut like command (or control on windows) + g (which is a familiar shortcut in other tools) and then also have a button in the chrome gui for plebs that don't want to use keyboard shortcuts could just be a little extension button to the right of the url bar that quite obviously looks like a button that will group something needs an inactive state though, to show that you can't click it unless you have multiple tabs selected and then when you have 1> tabs selected, it activates could do it with an opacity/colour change also, it would be wicked if you could then immediately name the groups i.e. the moment you press command+g, the new group of tabs auto focusses to an input field where you can give the group a name type the name, hit enter then you could do some really cool shit after that, like intelligently trying to name the tab based on the content of the group a bit like how ios automatically names folders i.e. if you create a group of tabs like including facebook, twitter, etc. auto name it 'social' hmmm auto naming might be doable maybe i'll make a default set of auto naming and let people just make a config to let people put in what sites make tabs auto name to ahhh coming up for ideas for functionally is so easy yep all about execution e? ye you mid game? nah e tonight? btw look at gigs dope i feel pretty ill today so will see how i feel tomorrow morning wuh oh did you go to the docs maybe its all the gluten nah, not that sorta ill got a sore throat bit of a cough should be fine tomorrow hopefully oh sounds like yellow fever god damn when is someone going to make a shot for common colds yes, that's probably the one e tonight? i'm ill and i want to go home and do fuck all noice yeah i am doing nothing dope snooker? i think we should reduce the length of the guides yeah it's basically cheating we can make em short n thicc just how i like em you working today? naw e? i took the day off sick 🌝 wut 🌖🌗🌘 🌚 i'm confooosed 🔤 you're such a faggot i know im a faggot on discord tho my man joe fukk meant to put it in the stream hahahaha when was that? that must be pretty old now no idea snapchat gave me a notification about memories and it was sitting in there look at that turkey chin and the tiny phone good god the chin and the facial hair grim e? soon dope what u doin faggot have paitence young grasshopper soon the time will be upon kek ayylmao you can make yourself a nice jacket im pretty sure this is impossible in javascript without becoming mad complicated rip dream hmm stack overflow is your friend wow thanks i havent tried that its more that theres only like 2 ways to save a completed web page and doing that just throws up a load of download notifications in chrome which looks lame does pete do js stuff or just php oh you only should be saving the url i think or a mixture of the two i.e. save locally for 30 seconds incase they re-open and then timeout the local version after that time fall back to just the url as a string saving a local version is hard as heck well you shouldn't be saving the .html that's pointless eh you effectively need to keep the tab open but hide the tab visually maybe cant hide tabs saving the page through the browser won't work i know because you'll just be saving the .html ive got that far no it'll have no styling ive been saving it as an mthml which saves everything but it still isn't hooked up to their servers right? like the js won't work for forms and things no and authentication for things like facebook won't work? nope yeah then that's pretty pointless i think theres a reason someone hasnt made it already why cant chrome just have that it would make it so simple i think the best thing to do from a ux pov is to just save the page url because ultimately even if you could just hide them visually in the browser gui, they'd still be eating up resources in the background which in chrome is already a nigihtmare it would encourage people to have even more tabs open and use even more ram yeah ok maybe time for a respec instead of being about to use them offline they just load themselves again woo easy yep you can even do some cacheing stuff within that i think to improve loading times but leave that as an after though thought* ezpz what were you thinking for switching groups like ctrl+1,2 etc or a clicky menu gui your apm will suffer but ok add shortcuts too but you'll need to research existing shortcuts for chrome and popular tab managers other extensions etc to make sure it doesn't clash fancy a game? im goin out in 10 🗿 kk kek are you on the voddy yep going oooot russian cure for the common cold make sure you squat of course i'll squat my way out enjoy the tinnitus i shall can you link me those fucking ear plugs mate what a link prime now them to the pub £25? what the fuck they're good my dude is 25 quid really that much to not have hearing damage every time you go out they're super low profile too so no one ever notices them hmmm will order to work i'm trusting your stingy opinion trust bruh i've had em for like a year and a half now and i wear them at least once a fortnight they're good shit dope when are you back from work? i am back e in a bit? just walking home ye just eating im making chilli so im gunna be in and out so maybe once im done kk i'm having chilli too 👊 epic god that's one thing i don't miss about being with molly her watching fucking pewdiepie all the time hahahahhahahahahha meme review👏🏻👏🏻 so funny xd i'd always just be sat there like 🌚 🌝 can we watch good comedy instead 3 hours of 9/11 memes literally anything is better than that fucking shit cookin son oh i meant to reply on whatsapp discord even fuck i'd literally rather watch 3 hours of raw 9/11 footage e d g y i've never watched him nigga is that your "chilli"? lol not that sorta chilli chilli bean sauce ayylmao what chilli black bean chicken it's not beef obviously wow thanks for clearing that up is it pork? fuck off it's not very obvious from the name tbh yeah true i'm on now btw just ping when done 👏👏 u done u faggot ? 👽 ? everyone's either ill or wfh on my team 🗿 you'd better post some good memes then fml i'm so fucking bored i got a powerball it's so fucking weird freaks me out what's a powerball like the lottery? google it you'll have a good chuckle what the fuck is that it's to improve your grip strength people use it for climbing it's a bit small to climb isn't it? i could do that it's deceptively small it's just really far away ahhhh how does it work you basically pull a cord to get it spinning and it has a weighted gyroscope in it that rotates at a really high rpm and you hold it in your hand and rotate your wrist slowly stabilising it as you rotate basically so you're sitting there trying to start a lawn mower and waving a ball around are you wearing your harness too i'm not doing it at work... hahaha it's not a gym and i don't wear that thing at work either because it looks horrific where do you find all this shit someone i climb with recommended powerballs for grip strength and my pt recommended it too oh warp zone? his name evolves over time doesn't it it's just at the right level of forgettable and malleable good old warp zone going to warp my fat to the zone ur ears are gunna be so protected hell ye so grant is meant to be wfh but i just went on discord and it says he's online playing poe lmao i got a notification that he played stuff on rhythmbot kek ikr e? at the pub iiight just picked up on a fucking golden always sunny line which i should use on a date dennis to the waitress on their date "have you got any makeup on" waitress "yeah?" dennis "have you got anymore?" kek what episode is that also there's new americ anfootball when he threatens to bang the waitress and then she bangs frank is it terrible? better than lp2 it's more dreampopy hmm interesting shall listen e? do you use headspace? i think you said you did? i did i do is it actually any good? is it worth giving a go? oh no the one i have is called aware the dev was giving away jets in reddit keyat jets? keys on i see is it good? why that over headspace? i thought headspace was the best one? it's alright? i'm still not sure if it's actually useful or if it's just telling me to breath in weird ways some of them seem like prime bullshit yeah, i think that's the general gist of it it's all about breathing, right? i wonder if there's a simpler way to do it like... just have something that times your breathing rather than reading shit to you and charging you a monthly fee it's got some stuff you're supposed to think about like concentrating on parts of your body or whatever i'm sure there's a free one out there that's just as good this is the bit which i don't get i think its supposed to just be things to stop you thinking about whatevers bothering you so by concentrating on something weird like that i guess it does its job i see hmm maybe there's actual science to it i guess theres gotta be something to it maybe why'd you have to go on holiday we could have gone to this oh yeah i forgot send me your cv i was gunna try improve it wasn't i oh yeah i'll send it when

bit but we can play an untimed game or something also every time i look at the meme chat it annoys me that aaron used "generally" instead of "genuinely" wow that is pretty moronic classic aaron that oi fam you got a rice cooker? nope why you thinking of getting one to draw the azns in azns? oh wow yeah, they'll come running no doubt every asian person i've ever know has ha one that's like 2 people so i can extrapolate from that so what you're saying is every asian ever has a rice cooker that seems to be what my peer reviewed data is saying >peer reviewed yes you heard i think i'll regress now i've made myself perfectly redundant 👍 you shoukd probably get one though they look pretty useful i only do rice a couple of times a week so i've never managed to justify getting one yeah, i think i will i also have ended up having the microwave shit loads because i'm lazy and it's super expensive so i'm just gunna buy like a 4kg bag of rice totally didn't realise but hot fuzz was filmed in wells where my family lives now just watched it mad tings thats a goldmine of instragam likes youve uncovered there ikr what are you gunna do with them all idk i'll have to make room for them somewhere i'm full up atm see if you can exchange them for reddit karma post in r/movies or some shit theyll lap that shit up btw what you doing on the sunday before new years i.e. the day before cause i'm gunna get back to london before and will have fuck all to do could do something the day before and new years eve before going out or whatever and adam is going out with a bunch of people,

something or other classic will getting into some mental chess matches i was just gunna send you a link lol uhhhh in a bit im busy ricing linux at the moment because i enjoy penis so fucking much ricing linux? pouring rice all over it to get it nice and starchy nice maybe i should do that for the asians hmmm youd probably only attract the male ones have you not heard of ricing before you must have done also http://www.worldsnooker.com/ripstone-lab42-and-world-snooker-announce-snooker-19/ nah, i just googled it looks like some sort of custom build thing guessing it's like making your own

other day cause some girl wanted to send me nudes and literally nobody had a story on it i went to the right bit and there was nobody on it it's complete garbage also, she sounds like a bit bot* yeah i know right im pretty sure she is but also i'm not downloading snapchat and actually using it so i guess that's the end of the line for me lol i feel you i often match with a decent looking girl and have an average convo but just cannot be fucked ikr i do that with almost everyone i match with just give up mid chat the thing that really pisses me off is when i start up a conversation with a girl but it's one sided i.e. it's always me asking questions even if the responses are interesting/long they often just leave it at that and don't ask anything back like wtf yeah right if its more than like 2 things where they just answer i stop ain't worth tha time yep, i think it's a good rule two lives are you working? nah cheeky game of chess? i'm wfh kek i'm tidying my room at the moment but when i'm done yeah dope download lichess and chess.com on your phone they both have these daily puzzle things that are great i'm learning loads from them yeah i've got it i just blast my way through the practice bit whenever i've gotta wait for whatever same it has replaced facebook it's great i think i took something of yours accidentally its like a strechy thing with loops on either side oh ye? i think you put your feet through them or hands ohhh or maybe its your weird bdsm stuff yeah don't touch it jokes no worries just bring it back next time i was just gunna say, i found my old kanken if you wanna buy it nah theyre literally the normiest backpack now reeeeeee yeah i know i bet i can sell it for a decent amount im sure i might get a new one and sell the carhartt one find a girl with dyed hair it's the only remaining link instant dolla yeah tru carhartt backpack? whcih dat it's really nice its such an odd shape just a tad wide and molly's rents got it for me so i feel somewhat violated when i use it for utility because it's great for transporting shit cause it's huge nice at least you can recoup some of the costs of that relationship lmao it was fucking expensive i've got so much more money now how much the backpack i mean oh i meant the relationship i think the backpack was like 80 or something i'm bored wfh so i decided to pluck hair from my nose look at this one fucking nostril >taking away his natural filtration while living in london you gunna die now nigga hahaha this is just a long term commit die chess? still tidying my room is a shithole mice nice* lol someone just dmed me on the monzo forums asking to buy all my shares for £10 per share 😩😩😩😩😩 do i hold or do i fold what would i do with £13,000... go on r/wsb lose it all obviously this is up to you my dude thats a pretty good x you got but do you think you can more x i'm not sure about the xs so many questions ugh see its all about the x's will capital gains fuck me too just dont declare it lmao great advice i got u just say you found it on the street and someone stole your shares tbh with the way theyre going theyre gunna be worth more didnt they just raise like 20 million in like a fortnight that was a meme btw lol yeah i mean i think they have potential to double in 2 years dude that a huge x but that really is the absolute limit in my mind enormous colossal x i mean itll take up your entire room £26k would literally be a flat deposit youll have to hire a crane to get that x out your flat when you move 🏗 ❌ you got it i think you should ride it out i think you're probably right it's so tempting though imagine receiving that amount of money in to your bank account i think i'd actually shit what right there middle of a meeting sorry boys just got my money through gotta get the spares out the desk hell ye just fucking drop a huge turd in the middle of the room if i'm fired so what exactly thing is i'll get taxed loads of it increases a lot more capital gains is like 11k free yeah but itll still go up its not like they start taxing the first 11k once you hit a bracket obviously but the gains beyond that become less profitable hmm true you should probably sell it all then tbh you fukkin gnomebag i think it's taxed quite low actually seems like it's about 15% ride the wave 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊 ye £12k now or £20k or something in like 16-18 months? d: obviously 20k i just keep imagining someone sending me £12,000 and then being like what do now i think i'd probably do something stupid like buy a boosted board like buy a macbook ye that was pretty silly but fun as fuck no regrets it was v fun i enjoyed both the experience of using it and not having to buy it to use it hahahaha i knew you were going to say that you should probably keep making loads of money so i can play with all your rich man toys this is why i come to you for financial advice because you have a vested interest i'll get a one wheel next a what one sec hahahaha the fucking website is amazing oh wow you can buy it on finance for $80 a month motorized e u p h o r i a wow i can't belive that's a direct quote however jokes aside i'd love one of these but not in london thats so operator they're also illegal in the uk kek are they too powerful yep well, sort of i think it has something to do with the fact that you don't have to pedal at all to engage the motor so it's technically considered a motorbike or some shit but in the states it's considered a bicycle so anyone can ride one they go like 30mph or something freedome 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 but the acceleration is meant to be insane and also, it looks fucking sick that one is a bit gross there's other ones that just look like choppers you can get the big chopper style lights on the front of them too and don't forget the clown horns wow i hate it oh no will i knew you'd hate it thats so embaressing and that's why i love it i know but ironically doing something embarrassing is still embarrassing touche you should blast some lil pump when you ride round and take son xans you should get one i could mock you literally endlessly for it i will only ever get one if i'm a, really rich and b, live in the middle of nowhere neither of this things are likely to happen especially simultaneously imagine if youre so rich you can hire a driver to drive you around on it best of both worlds init did i tell you about riding scoot? who is scoot sounds kinda gay ahhh fuck they rebranded it's still really, really funny though grant and i had quite a laugh about this hahahahahah what the fuck is this i mean what do they actually do is it like a bike taxi or for moving goods n shit both you can sit two people on the front of it why would anyone ever use them i dont understand it's fucking funny as fuck i don't understand either but it's just so funny imagine being sat on the front of one of those things it looks so precarious and unsafe it looks fucking terrifying and youre relying on some poor person thats gotta cycle all day not to get you killed by a car i don't think they even realise that there's a kid dabbing in this one i feel so bad for everyone involved with this me too me too... why are you using the light theme on discord :^) it's slack faggot :^) which doesn't have a dark theme for some godforsaken reason cant you hack one in with css i guess maybe it is a web view i think just get into the mainframe and

i ever needed, how did i ever live before without product™ products are great so i purchased some cream from spain that you can't buy over the counter in the uk and it arrived in a parcel with this on it wtf why is it upside down kek he lied about his last name to make it seem like a gift thats amazing yeah ikr super fucking dodgy i think he must literally just go to a pharmacy buy a bunch of it and then stick it on ebay in the uk just flips it bet he's making bank what is it have you bought darkening cream darkening cream? it's cream for stretch marks trying to get rid of my fat marks thought you might be trying to make lethal weapon 6 ahh yeah that would make total sense do you get extra shares when i sign up then of course ✡✡✡🔯🔯🔯🕎🕎🕎🕎🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱 👃 lol i'm going to do some

remember the good ol gym days maybe i'll just roll down so this app you get free money out of me for what do you actually use it for in budgeting i've just started to it's good so far hows it different from just like writing some numbers down you connect your bank account and it tracks it automatically lol wot so you don't have to fuck around tracking stuff manually you let it read your bank account nice also i just looked at that gold amex yeah it's open banking though so it's safe monitored by the fca no write access either ye? i said that prematurely im still reading through it all so after year 1 you have to pay £140 do you really get that much out of it yeast e? yah yah yeast im gunna make dinner soon but in like 20 mins as in cool, i'll have dinner too i will start making dinner in 20 minutes dope i'll do the same whats on the menu does your sweat smell like tuna yet nope been upping the chicken but tuna is on the menu tonight actually chicken of the sea init ya boi getting abs worth it pigeon of the sea are you gunna start wearing musclefits i think you should youd look really cool good lord it's a no from me so tight you can see my abs give it time im sure you will in a few months i hope my body is good enough to consider it but it'll still be a no forever but how are you gunna flex on dudes on the street youre gunna have to pop that top off real quick yeah i'd prefer that tbh it's restricting my movement anyway unlike my denim shorts that were jeans i cropped off or oh hell yeah best of both worlds i will certainly start cutting my sleeves off i mean obviously e? yes i got distracted by watching 5 episodes of parcs and rec give me 8.34 classic cool will only be on for an hour or so me rn oh yes i see nice i'm downing water like a mad cunt today my skin is going to be so fucking elastic wow can i do an experiment on you? what do you think you're gay or something i guess if you're gentle ffs i wanted to basically write a blog post or something that guides you on how to lose weight/re-compose your body. i.e. drop body fat % and increase lean muscle right so where does your joey salads experiment come in so you want me to pretend to kill my friends with a prop gun lmao it's a social experiment gone sexual this guy went from a fat fuck to a shredded addonis with 0% body fat in just one week with *this* blog post and this supplement e tonight? afraid i am out this evening ill be back at like 11 if youre still on then ye just got back two tired fair me too e? ywa yes just got off lol ive been getting off the entire time hahahaha fantastic reference my holiday for the day after fidlar was approved 👌 ayyyyyy gunna b rad ye boi bonus pay day too oh yeah, i got a new camera was gunna suggest we going and take some pictures on the fri or sat that's an idea we can go do that dope you've got sat off too, right? yis cool maybe we can find another gig or somin probably it's peak gig season it's all kicking off oh really? what gigs are on? i mean late january is the start of gig season there's nothing specific there's that one on wednesday night but i'm still not decided if i have the arsed to go i do want to see them though i didn't even know that it there was a season for gigs yeah it's weird e tonight? i got fuck all on there seem to be more big ones that i want to go to from like january - may probably i'm going to do that thing again just as my legs have become normal i see but i'll be around at some point you were back pretty early last time i doubt i'll be on until like half 7 anyway i is on now i want to do some stuff on loonix for a bit actually ill see if i can fix my mic then best of both worlds also what do you do with your dumbells at home i have some sitting around that i may as well make use of was it stuff that windows 98 told you to do or did you just google it huh windows 98? oh ffs that was a stretch i mainly just do arms at home with dumbells bicep curls, hammer curls, rows, extensions and lateral raises bicep curls works the peak of your bicep and your forearms, hammer curls works your forearms a bit more (and the tendons between that and your bicep area) and mainly a muscle called the brachialis rows work your triceps and your lats extensions are the same and lateral raises work your delts so basically with those you hit your entire arm and your shoulders a bit can do shoulder presses too and shrugs to hit your traps right why don't lateral raises work your lats actually i'll just look it up because in that context it's just referring to the movement it's nothing to do with your lats you raise the dumbells laterally dang i wanted to find my longs huh i know where my lats are now onto my longs then i know the location of my bodyt i see i feel like you dont get the joke otherwise you would be laughing yeah oh latitude i see im still disappointed by this outcome kek ill take the pity kek i thought you'd be use to it by now youd think so but here i am with the familiar pity kek pang i is bored y u not gam guh youre so needy im not actually doing anything i couldnt be bothered im just watching parcs and rec ill finish this one kk thanks i hate it the picture? yes or me generally yes cool is that your weight or bitcoin heyooo my eth holdings ye is it possible to get the amount of protein this recommends i dont think it is what recommends? oh the video? what's your suggested macros? no the fitness pal what has it calculated e tonight? oh yeah thats what i was doing the mobile app is way better than the web app btw i mean... you've eaten fucking nothing i just yeeted down some mixed nuts eat meats, beans, lentils, nuts, wholegrains dairy that's why people use whey it makes it way easier to hit your macros see what i did there yeah that was a proper zinger you can just add whey powder to anything and increase the protein content what does it taste like depends unflavoured doesn't really taste of much i get a chocolate flavoured one mmmmmm just have it with water in a shaker sprinkle that shit on my £30 cut of beef it's so fucking cheap too so much protein if you compare it to chicken or whatever what price per gram of protein is insanely low whey is cheaper than chicken see this is why i go to you for advice eat tuna too and salmon you make sure i dont require a fundamental understanding of anything so what does eating more protein do does it make you b i g you should watch those videos i sent but basically the tldr is that when you workout you damage muscle fibers your body rebuilds them to be stronger but in order to rebuild them, your body goes through a process called protein synthesis which requires there to be protein in your system to rebuild so eating high protein diets is only really necessary if you're working out or if you're eating in a caloric deficit (trying to lose weight). in this case, you'd do it to maintain muscle mass while losing body fat simultaneously i'm on 160g of protein a day and i do intermittent fasting to maximise the amount of fat my body burns instead of muscle during that window this means that my eating window is between 12pm and 8pm so between those hours i need to get 160g of protein and your body can't use more than 30g of protein per meal so i have many small meals throughout that window to maximise the amount of protein my body can use for synthesis does that make sense? i don't track sodium btw that's why it's 2k over lol ur so close to your macros that's fine +/- 5% is fine as long as you're consistent hmmmm i dont think ill be consistant maybe i will who knows maybe ill snarf down a can of lentils for dinner just try tracking for a bit aight wait what i read yours wrong you used 100g of peri peri sauce with dinner? what the fuck whats so much thats* it's probably wrong probably more like 50g thats an insane amount of salt for a bit of sauce yeah, i feel like their macros for it might be wrong hhmm according to the website its even worse for you 100g of it has 6g of salt not 2.4 hmmm maybe i should cut that out what about sriracha ? tbf the rest of my diet is really really low in salt why is it so high in salt that's insane basically all hot sauce has shit loads of salt it just makes it stay longer peak i made some out of some chillis i grew and it had like barely any in it was top shit but it only lasted like a week there must be a brand that's low in salt surely there's a market for that yeah there probably will be but itll probably taste like shit maybe swap it out for some other kind of sauce you should make your way to soy sauce its got fuck loads of salt but you only use like a splash of it hmmm could try soy sauce it's a bit samey though and sort of dull nah bruh sprinkle a bit of ginger and garlic in with it youre in flavourtown hmmm ginger can you get ground garlic in a thing yeah get ground both also, i'm on discord now i use them whem in lazy aint going to the gig managed to sell both the tix dope i shall do that ayyyy when i've been paid bruh they cost like a quid each yeah but i wanna do a big food shop so i'll just get them when i go do that oh yeah you can get a colossal container then if youre doing a giant food shop yep ill be on soon doing dinner also theres some army training going on near me and people are complaining about it on the facebook stay at home mummy page this fucking absolute genius showed up computer generated noise *tank firing* bloop beep you coming on? am bored af 🐎 yes ill go to windoze cus its so boring lol 💁🏻‍♂ im in the call saying hello you clearly can't hear me not sure about this new fidlar my dude pretty tame oh is it out? i'll give it a listen i'm sure they'll play the good ol stuff lol yeah this is wank hopefully they won't be playin much of it i suspect they will i feel like they're trying to be more mainstream the classic ever since he got sober the music has been worse 🤔 maybe we should keep buying him drinks and having them sent on stage i think so vape some meth and blow it in his face so he gets second hand high hell ye well theyre playing a gig tonight so we can take a peek at the setlist and see whats up i see good plan kek what theyre playing a free show at house of vans on the 30th top kek lol so nobody likes it? there's a surprise maybe it's because it's totally different to everything else they've produced maybe building a fan base around a style and then just abandoning it isn't the best idea who'd have thunk it they released this like 5 months ago what happened its not as intense as their good shit but its still slaps o dear m8 my arms are getting fucking dench youd better be careful you dont accidentally flex and burst the arms on your jumpers oh hell yeah toilet lighting is gr8 at work sweet i can go have a wank now 🎉 thanks im going to save this in my /will/reflections/arms folder keep building that collection e? oh no i just got home i hope ur enjoying watching sunny tho xo e? ehh i dont feel like playing games hungover? nah i think im just bored of all of them all video games fair if you find one that looks pretty good maybe also how long ago did i sign up for that xbox thing lol kk i meant to remember but i did not probably need to angel cancel yeah i think i do crazy dat sea of theives is 50 quid its got like nothing to do in it ye it's pretty good but not enough content it should be £20 tops ayy it runs out tomorrow what a time to remember dude i'm a 29 waist now wtf 34 to 29 i must've been so fucking fag fat well, fag too you were thicc and gay dont buy new jeans yet you might get those waist gains i gunna get one pair they'll stretch anyway and i've already got bigger sets from when i was getting progressively thinner watch out your legs don't get too buff otherwise they'll explode your jeans along with your sleeves at least your mobility will increase then chess? hmmmm ill partake in an untimed game yes so i saw i hope they are good they're as good as your pawn structure thanks its the classic spearhead technique its ok to feel intimidated as i advance into your centre u gunna move or nah? nah ggwp 😴 i woulda let you i didnt realise you wanted to take back 2 kek good game though fair win to me that game was so long and boring sometimes chess games are long will ive got to sit and consider every permutation of the board not something that is done quickly oh also my erm inner elbow? both of them are weird and sore its pain to straighten my arms i went on bodybuilding.com and they said i cant do anything until it goes away how sad is that oh weird i've never had that is it joint pain? what were you doing? what exercise caused it? i have no idea it crept in the evening after i did some stuff with my dumbell as in a day latter later is it your joints its not joint pain tho or the muscle its just in me muscles oh okay that's natural its like whatever muscle keep that protein intake up and rest that's why you should have two days between training if you put your hand palm up for a specific muscle group whatever muscle is on the top of your forearm near the elbow oh that's totally natural that happened to me just rest and then go again that'll fade your forearms are just weak comparatively to your biceps do some grip training to improve your forearms i think i know what it was i did some wrist things whatcha call em like curls but for your wrists should i get some of those things the squeezy bois oh nah they don't really carry over that well maybe get the trainer one and do negatives i..e. use your other hand to close it then slowly release it with one honesty a power ball would be great for that probably it's hard to know exactly where in your arm you're referring to though right i'm on a date catch ya later lol what youre on a date why are you messaging me you nerd yeah that's what i thought bicep curls may be enough i'm not she's not here yet but she's about to be hence the goodbye did you tear off your sleeves make sure you find something high up to grab and show off a bit of waist ok don't worry i've already mentioned creatine shits that's good that shows actual use of the product you should find a body of water if possible jaws eh i wonder if itll be full of 12 year olds like last time potentially but i'm game either way ya boi got laid ayyy hmmm but you didn't buy her cheesy chips i don't understand shock chess? timed minus the shits do you slosh when you walk around like a waterbed nah but i lift like an eagle nice using your powerful wings to generate thrust wardor gets so pissed off cause i just end up flying around with the bar between sets you should grow your toenails out so you can strike people with aerial attacks ah but you see then i can't climb why would you climb a flap of your wings and your height wont be dependent on plebbs bits of tall earth plebby true that's a great inspirational quote might get it framed put it on a mug next to your im nice at ping pong mug ~ greg leonard, 2019 the typo ruins it no you can fix that send it again with proper grammar a flap of your wings and your height wont be dependent on plebbs [sic] bits of tall earth - greg leonard, 2019 the sic make it look offical or does it go before the word probably before a flap of your wings and your height wont be dependent on plebby bits of tall earth i can finally straighten my arms without muscle pain its only taken me 5 days to recover wow that'll go down should be 2 days tops after you're trained impressive right it's telling me to weigh myself waddya think up or down huh you should weigh yourself every morning at the same time then take the mean of the 7 days every week only compare averaged weights per week anything between that doesn't account for natural fluctuations in weight from hydration, etc. interesting i have not done thwtn thwt that you should definitely do that it's one of the most important things cause your calculated bmr from mfp may be inaccurate everyone is different for example, if mfp suggests you eat at a 500cal deficit to lose 0.5kg a week, but you end up losing 1kg, then you should increase your calorie intake or you'll fuck your matabolism metabolism bruh you can't just throw acronyms my way and lose muscle instead of fat i got mfp ah basically like idle calorie burn there's a formula for figuring it out you can find spreadsheets that do it pretty helpful hopefully the snow that's forecast later on in the week won't cuck your train journey oh yeah shit when's that forecast for tomorrow night should be fine i think it's just one day it's forecast for hopefully gone by thursday will it be able to get through the pollution anyway true probably not the gas bubble will save us cancer > snow e? afraid im off out shortly ight oh yeah ed had that in third year you

sooooo weird nah he's great ahhahahaha he just makes everyone squat wtf this is amazing how have you not heard of him the mad lads series is amazing idk i am a subscriber now tho look at vulfs latest insta post wow check out my workout routine: 'pull': are they safe wow it's such a good forum wow i'm glad you took time out of your evening to produce that you can use it if you want thanks my dude so generous no problem my reward is just knowing ive helped dont like that square full stop though but that circle one is too big why dont you put some techy punctuation in it instead like //evident or \evident/ it draws your eye in like a funnel playin around with colour i like the full stop makes it feel punchy yeah i feel like its blasting me when i read it get blasted i get to the end of the word and its just like kaboom end evident - nationwide ass blasting but you can blast their ass with design red is a bit edgy try a less edgy colour hmmm but black and white is edgier and that would be my other choice but it looks like soylent wait no the other one huel what if you make like the dot a colour and nothing else now thats edgy huel is black and white i know but its basically the same ???? big ol white plain background startup font if you rearrange the letters it spells out huel what the fuck he's insane this playlist is fucking great you should buy a napalm death hoodie and grow your hair out yes okay i was thinking a nails longsleeve tbh pfft thats weak obviously you get nails shorts so you can wear them to the gym ayylmao hell ye then people will know youre the toughest dude like watch how hes got hardcore shorts on theyll sense the self loathing for miles off here we go wow what the fuck i know imagine if you actually paid money for them also you should probably add some fear factory though a lot of it is wanky industrial i can't believe they exist i shall listen eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee soon buyin insurance kk 😢 yikes oof cars r awful yup some guy at work is paying like 150 a month cus he keeps crashing into people it's insane wow wow* ᵥᵥₒᵥᵥ im really annoyed that aaron has posted such a poor meme in the chat because ive got a great one do you want me to buffer it with something not shit but i feel like by posting it im going to have to acknowledge it yeah a buffer could be a good excuse e eating but then we cane kool this is dope free backends rip pete's job kek that's so gunna be shut down why? wait is it like hosted on drive it's a google sheet ye yeah but i wasn't sure if it just got it from a google sheet then gave you a thing you stuck on your own hosting so if anything biggish uses it googled gunna be all like dis nigga using all our bandwidth for free oh i see i think they've already accounted for this for normal sheets usage i think there's a cap for the free tier so people will just hit those limits quicker so they'll make more money if anything oh so it's an actual feature of it but that just makes it easier well, google doesn't intend for you to use it as a backend and they might not be okay with that for data protection reasons but it won't cost them any money because they charge people who have loads of data already regardless of whether it's accessed via their gui or some janky api plugin someone's made but isn't it more about the amount of people that access the data rather than the actual size of the db i guess they've also accounted for that in their pricing number of users i suspect and yeah, with an api you'd hit that limit very fast unless you have some middle layer elsewhere like we have with wellth something that polls all endpoints and caches the data so you don't have thousands of clients all sending api requests to the same endpoints simultaneously can you help me find a funny name for my snooker cue is that possible lol what have you come up with nothing thus far other than human names like simon cause it sounds funny trying to give something an intentionally funny name is almost always cringy just call it the yeeter or some bullshit at least thats ironic jesus it has to be ironic obviously but yeet? irony? a yeet is the only thing that cannot be ironic what are you talkin about nigga ive never yeeted unironically i dont think i could even could kenneth nailed it and you thought brian shaw was big... wtf  i think hes just got tiny legs and it standing in shallower water

don't like them they like me tinder gold init o shit i forget you have that theyre probably just casting a wide net to hold up their insurmountable girth 🤑🤑🤑💶💵💸💰💰💸💷💳💎💎💎⚖ i laughed a lot at that very

n:narcissistic politics i:ignorant s:stupid hahahahahaha fuck that's so good that's the best meme i've seen in a while i knew i had to give context for the full meme inpact impact outstanding good damn you've got me back on the pendulum hype this is u yep my weird facial hair induced double chin will soon be no more >facial hair induced uhhhhhhh it definitely makes it look a heck of a lot worse true if it grows enough you can just hide it all beneath the hair also the meme himself scooby1961 has a push/pull/legs workout only problem is i have to wear a bucket hat or fedora while working out ye exactly it's going anyway cause skinny who's that i see niggawatt yeah that'll limit your gains you dont know about scooby nope hes a classic fit meme he posts on fit all the itme he does videos showing how to work out and always wears a fedora or bucket oh hell ye wow who are these guys ive never heard of them idk just appeared on my discover weekly kinda like em theyre just so unknown (i do know who they are this is a meme) oh who is utb it i don't even remember unknown mortal orchestra oh ye i've never heard of them what do you think about this http://scoobysworkshop.com/intermediate-workout-plan/ its still scooby so its meme worthy but it could be a good base looks pretty good to me i basically made my own by looking for the best pull exercises and push legs is easy yeah i had a look you just want to make sure you're doing compound stuff but i have no understanding of all the bits it would need to cover that's the most important yeah look up muscle anatomy it's surprisingly simple and there's plenty of apps out there that let you search for excersises by name and then show you what muscles they hit >surprisingly simple and thats just the t r u n k not to that level you don't need that much detail just understand the main groups traps, delts, lats, back(upper/lower), tris, bis, chest, forearms, core, glutes, quads, hip-flexers, hamstrings, calves that's all you really need to think about ^ pictures of single muscles with the rest taken out look so fucking weird hahaha theres a few of his i cant do cus he uses a bar as in a hanging one most things you can do with a barbell you can do with either dumbell or kettlebell variations google "exercise name dumbell alternative" pretty much all of them have one no i mean like pullups oh well, get a pull up bar pull ups are pretty essential damnit for your back lats mainly maybe i can diy gym it and find a beam in the garage yeah, or do australian pull ups with rings you can just wrap them around a beam done so many options they cost like £15 or something what the rings or the door bar thing the rings the door thing was like £5-10 i think can't remember specifically but not much and you wouldn't need that anyway if you have a beam you have way more options because you live in a huge house just get a pull up bar it'll be way better i wish i could have one but alas i live in rented accomodation this dude looks like hes in a fucking mech wow if you could get one of them that's be great captains chairs are amazing nah fuck that theyre like 80 quid could do leg / knee raises dips pull ups i think at this point id get way more out of another dumbell then a weird bdsm contraption yeah get a dumbell for sure and make sure you have a decent bench are they your ones you can use piano stalls yeh bruh ive been using me piano bench ye, don't have a barbell though work out the mind and the body on that i do nice and i suppose also the soul get a dumbell, a kettlebell and a pull up bat bar done that's all you need wait no mind body spirit thats it level 3 baby ill find those dumbells without the bar look how a e s t h e t i c jesus they're awful i just like to imagine the sort of collosal wanker that would buy them check some of the reviews >these are very shiny and smart, it was worth paying extra to get these rather than black ones. kek ha its just stickers of a wood texture i thought it would be at least like a really thin insert yeah that's trash but i have no sympathy for anyone buying them so 🤷‍♀ true they deserve it might buy a windows laptop and put ubuntu on it nah dude use arch or gentoo or i could get a chromebook put ubuntu on it would cost nothung nothing* e bumble have updated the web version and now it's actually good god tinder's is fucking awful at junkyard golf init oh shit you're in ldn? date? that girl essex girl ? yeah that one i talk to i see g'warn son sad tims totally would but naught to stay at can you not go to hers? nah she lives in chelmsford with fam oi can i crash at yours home is long af to yo sorry was in a game loooong i'm just going to sleep i'm up early 😵😵😵 laaammeee how early 7 fuck i'm getting in to bed now more notice my dude sorry 😔 your emojis do nothing to placate me aight that's cool enjoy ur rock climbing sorry dude thank you for understanding senpaj oh no i don't know who to have emotions at it's usually her but it's about her?? basically it's just we live far apart and are both into each other there is no solution thank u for ur rubber ducking will senpai that will be all i'm half asleep and somewhat confused by this i shall assess in the morning and offer some sort of reckon stay strong brother i'm accepting of a morning reckon i reckon you should continue talking to her things change, maybe she'll move or you'll move and then suddenly it'll be viable and long distance can work too... especially if it starts like that much harder to go from seeing eachother every day to being long distance than the other way around if you like eachother that much to enter in to a long distance relationship from the start then it definitely means something so just see where it goes, continue to see her and if you think it could work, ask her out that's my two cents my uninformed reckon# you're welcome e? thats some wise reckoning ill absorb it like the sponge i am also yes i wanna play apex ive seen some hype on it on v dope what piratebay link do you use these days? proxylist is down :( cool ur so needy it's called like unblocker or something it has a minecraft grass block also i'm bored af wanna play apex? i'm out at the moment playing some squash but when i return with the nick? yyp that's the boi game yes invited you to the discord server were on aight just gotta boot into spyware os hyuck hyuck wow respect my freedoms ya'll ni🅱🅱as still on nah just went off yo are you coming to the thing on saturday? could come up friday evening do something i wasn't planning on going really?? yeah i don't really care about seeing anyone apart from like ferg maddy and king fair everyone will be gutted though ehhh maybe v sad news there are no appropriate beams in my garage for pull ups its a sad day hmmmm i think these are the same im very suspicious though in the pictures the dude is wearing gloves i think he'll probably murder me wow yes he will but theyre 35 quid less worth it for sure theres so much cheap shit in portsmouth its really annoying why didnt i just get it there i mean i guess i could just drive down its like 40 minutes do it make a day of it build dat home gym kek i just went out and got these 24 quid not too shabby wow decent what weights are the plates? 2.5 works out pretty good cus ive got those 1.25 lil shitty ones too each? yeah each ah good nice bargain the dude wanted to meet at a petrol station which i thought was fair to make sure neither of us were murderes but when i got there and called him he was just like park up next to the garage ill meet you there and just came out the door next to the petrol station so he must live above it shouldnt have expected anything less from beautiful aldershot hahaa wow relayed that story to pete enjoyed does pete know about aldershot i find that aspect really puts the cherry on top but is still a flavourful story without whats that website you were talking about that showed you what exercises did which bits i think i can reasonably do everything i need apart from deadlift but im not sure theres any good replacements you can do kettlebell dead s or kettlebell swings they're pretty good hmmm can i just pile some weight on a dumbbell google kettlebell/dumbell replacement for deadlift or does it need to be the ketty boi idk google it and i've forgotten the name of the app fitbod or something hmmmm maybe ill see if theres a kettle somewhere on gumtree that someone doesnt want i'm sure there will be o shit la dispute at slam dunk its lookin pretty tite this year ye boi will be gr8 + touche i bet theyre gunna do that split together hype oh hell ye i've wanted to see touche for a while merch merch merch such a poseour yes im just after those la dispute socks wow they're nice my favourite thing about la dispute is that you can dress fully in their merch minus boxers wow there's la dispute shoes? i'm wfh today so will be on earlier if you fancy e ok its early now wanna play apex ye this is a very long meme it's fucking fantastic this philion dude is jokes trying to sell their bullshit i'm on btw someone just bought my gambino tickets for £200 lols that's no gambleino indeedy straight in the bank just saw someone go past on a one wheel also i'm so glad you keep sending me these bj angles what he sees 🍆 you should get some bands btw they're really cheap and you can do a load of stuff with them especially good for your back and shoulders reverse flys aw yiss ill just buy loads of gear and then never do anything with it they're like £10 not even that for a set of three hmmm i still need to get a door bar how the fuck do those ones work that are just like staffs? staves? they like screw in as in you rotate them and they extend each side yeah i figured you have to shove them in somehow but they just seem terrifying yeah, i've never had one of them i think the hook over ones are better ye also ive decided my arms are weak and its limiting everything i do like lol lets do a plank oh no wait my arms are dead guess im not doing that anymore hmmm arms shouldn't really effect your blank might be your shoulders or back maybe but my arms get tired from holding myself up so i suspect its my arms i'd recommend just starting a proper split/program so you're working everything over a week yes ok how why what where do you want me to just make you a program to start out? based on the kit you've got at home that might be easier what do you have? ive just been finding ones on the internet and then trying to make them fit i have dumbbells that is all that's fine are you planning on getting a pull up bar? ye and you've got a bench thing right? there was one im pompy as in like you can use a piano bench thing but theres one on amazon for 16 that looks good and petrol is mroe than 6 lol so imma just get it off amazon thank u captialism cool yeah ive got a lil piano bench i'll send something over in a bit when i've got a se c finish up that backlog so i can work on my back log nice yes im proud of that one a kettlebell would be really great so you can replace deadlifts with swings how heavy push/pull/legs probably 16kg eyyyyy nice one my dude righto time to find me a kettle i'd suggest warming up before all of these obviously not the cardio day but the others just do some mountain climbers or jumping jacks to get your heart rate up a bit for like 5 mins or something you'll perform the lifts better if you warm up first easier to get a pump i got for a 5 min run before every workout also, make sure you eat something before each i normally have a banana and a rice cake bit of quick carbs basically mm rice cake then eat a high protein meal after or a shake if you're lazy like me hmm i am lazy maybe i need many kg of whey whey is fantastic it's so fucking cheap it's insane idk why everyone doesn't have it daily it's like the cheapest, most convenient food if you get a kettlebell you can try kettlebell cleans too dw m8 im gunna polish that boi daily lol one other thing - once you start, make sure you're progressively overloading when you start out you'll make decent nooby gains so you should be able to up the weight pretty much every other week oof ok that's why it's a good idea to have other plates around smaller ones so you can gradually add weight aight google 'progressive overload' maybe ill hit up garage man he has many weights of all shapes and sizes also that workout app thing i got whatever it was called does it do anything apart from have a list oh yeah is it worth turning your thing into a strong i was gunna say i found it its called strong i got an add for one i screenshotted it one sec ad* kek i bet zucc saw me ask you yep is strong on android? ye cool just use that it should have all those exercises so just make three custom workouts and add those in use it to track the weight progression because it's important to know how you're progressing on the weight front and also motivating when you see the graph oh yeah and you're like "oh shit, i can actually life like 5kg more than i could a month ago on that lift" how exciting right ill make a stronk and google kettlebells cool if you want to maximise the gains you make, the only real diet change you have to make is to make sure you get enough protein the ideal is 20-30g of protein every 3 hours and don't skimp on carbs to compensate especially pre-workout how do i do incline press without like an inclined bench oh actually my desk chair leans back nicely i can probably just use that yeah exactly oof ouch my core owie did you do one? ye thursday minus pullups nice any good? ye cant do the 20 pushups i got to 9 yeah i put them at the end because i knew it would take you to failure which is good i think everything else was fine i used 10 for everything apart from lat raise and tricep extension which were 5 warpus made me do 60 push ups at the end of training this morning the last three reps took me about 15 minutes that sounds awful yeah lateral raises are fucking brutal gotta go super low weight on them i only do 4kg for laterals oh hecc if you ever find an exercise hard, you can do negatives too they're great for starting off as in go down rather than up as in, go up really fast with bad form then control coming down slowly don't do as many reps negatives are great for pull ups jump up then slowly let yourself down i slowly let myself down every day already nice thanks i thought that was good i've started doing lock offs which are good too it was my nice was legit lock offs are really good for climbing thatll be good for when i go climbing i wanted to italicise the i but there is no way to lol you should give climbing s go it's fucking great rapidly become the most enjoyable thing in my life each? e* my new keyboard isn't use to my bullshit yet what but arent you using your phone yeah switched to gboard cause it got better apparently hmmm interesting ive been using swiftkey forever same i'm not sure about it yet i'll report back what does it do what are the killerfeatures meant to have better autocomplete cause google decent haptic feedback on ios better swiping you can emoji search finally you can insert gifs and shit but the back arrow is so small it's triggering me so you can apparently gboard is default on android now i hate it it's new and different the layout may take a while to get use to but it seems better overall you can't change how tall it is wtf e memes fine fine ill boot to steve ballmers spywaretm yep that's it ballmer he's after all the data thought i'd drop you in it nice thank me later yu wot check the facebook chat for the weekend that you're not attending 👍🏿 e? wow is this content cop *gym man looking at butterfly that says phillion on it* pretty much lol i cant do pistol squats what do hmmmm just do more dumbbell squats instead or get a kettlebell and do swings and goblet squats fugg kettles are pricey hmmm just do dumbbell squats kettlebell swings are really good though for deadlift replacements im checkin some second hand stuff theres loads of cheap ones actually theyre just far noice fuck sake theyre far how long does it take people to give up on going to the gym for new year that wave is already over my dude lasts about a month balls hmm theres a 12kg one closeish but i dunno if thatll be enough not heavy enough really can u pick this up for me pls thx e? is that ginger and cinnamon on plain tuna jesus fucking christ the spice gods are looking down at you with anguish hahahahaha dw i added other stuff to it spinach rice hot sauce mmmmm lovely lovely sauce do you have taste buds do they work i think so? ginger and cinnamon are great they're good for you im not disputing that and they taste great my problem is the amount in the situation and the situation youve created itself wut oh i see that was a weird sentence youve made a weird thing lol all this shit "drink a cinnamon and ginger tea and it melts the fat off you" hahaha is that a thing link me up google it yourself you lazy fuck i looked it up cus you said it was healthy fuck you yeah, idk about ginger and i was dubious that any spices can have any effect on you but cinnamon is meant to boost insulin sensitivity so you burn more fat there's like actual research on it it's legit nice just eat cinnamon buns then then youre healthy yeah boi try assisted pistol squats i shall look into also can you look over my cv and give vomments its not done yet sure but im at the stage where input to steer it would be handy 👍 the formatting is fucky i'll check it out tomorrow oh right ill do some more work on it then cool would look now but going to sleep ???? you and your climbing yes you should read 'the subtle art of not giving a fuck' it's great i feel like you could relate to it a lot and get a lot out of it wait until it starts talking about muscles it's fucking great >increase your strength and muscle control you heard them alright, greg get on down to the snooker club and build those biceps wtf have i been using weights for you can just play cue sports thanks will wasting my fucking money on bits of metal sorry pal do both then they'll grow double as fast ill end up going through weights so fast they'll just become so light to me if i'm playing snooker too imagine if you strut into the gym with kenneth under your arm. those gym bros are gunna be miring the shit outta you maybe you can just double down and start adding weight to your cue think of the

like a german war criminal which was helped a lot by the fact i was bald at the time nice ah yes i remember this you did look like a german war criminal / concentration camp victim i like to play both sides like italy and mac 👌🏿 you up to anything saturday night/sunday? saturday night i'm going out with adam and his mates for his girlfriend's birthday to paino works piano* i'm sure you'd be welcome to come? and i'm not doing anything sunday ah the thing is on saturday night someone from old work is playing a gig but tbh it would probably be pretty uh not quite so polished i see e? ye dope nice front page meme if things are getting too easy should i add reps or weight or both or do they do different things weight usually if you want to build size progressive overload eh im not bothered about being hueg my goal is to not to look like a man sized baby i'd increase the weight a bit but not loads are you doing 4x12? after a while is cut the number of reps down for most things yeah depends on the lift but for compound stuff you want to get heavier and reduce reps so chest press for example can i do it exponentially go heavier can i do 1/256th of a rep at 900kg i guess i'd be very impressed also what is compound youre firing out memes at an exponential rate it's when a movement uses multiple muscles across two joints i think basically when you use a few muscles in a chain how do you even do a non compound exercise rather than isolating one muscle dont you have to use more than one muscle for basically everything a bicep curl is isolated like stabilisation n shit if you're doing it right like a preacher curl i guess if youre using your arm blaster yeah you can blast that bi boom 💯 ya boi met a gril last night oh shit waddup what does she do for a living is she a foreman i don't understand this reference 🤔 grill i see this message was deleted that *is* funny e? fuck this is so good wtf 🅱eter😂😂😂 apex? discord we're playing cs now but could do apex? what's that band i always made of you liking i remembered c and the b men oh yeah god how are they so fucking dull why are you listening to them? i'm guessing some tinder girl hahahha no i wanted to see if i was just uncultured back then but turns out i was right they're all songs that would be played over a slow motion aftershave ad i see yeah they're all the same every song is identical i like that one where it sou ds like they wanted money and made a catchy chorus do doo do oxygens overrated she's got a hurricane at the back of her throat isn't that every song? this is like chasing that radio play tier of catchy it's great right cs? goin out in a min maybe later if youre still on iight boi have i got a good meme for youj a dude came up to this bodybuilder in a gym and said "thank you for being muscular" ???? what thank you for being muscular what did mr muscles say he was just polite and said thank u that's very weird ikr it's great bruh for like 2 handed stuff like curls and jerkin off when its 12x4 thats 12 for each arm right cus ive been doin that ye alternate probably do like 24*4 for curls ye ive been alternating its like youre cheating gains out of thin air double the gains in half the time epic win amirite too true will sharpio ayylmao ikr nail on the proverbial head ill nail ur proverbial head m8 hahaha youre so diverse yes oui are you perhaps yellow that would explain your diversity maybe does that mean i get a job at ibm? i mean obviously if youre a yellow o shit son last time i did push i could only do 7 pushups ya boi up to 15 killer boom i'm doing pull today gunna do some fookin pull ups son o fugggg i need to get that pullup bar if i get it now itll arrive before pull do it pull ups are the best excersise period and dips also ive decided i cba with a kettlebell just gunna swing that dumbell yeah, that works put on hella weight n watch it fly isn't it super awkward to grip? how much weight do you use for lat raises 5kg nah i just hold it under the weight on the handle side and it swings nicely on each arm like goblet squats but grip the other way up i see that works callum von moger lat raises 20kg it's fucking insane where'd you go ? r u alive r u ok no i died and went to gamer heaven where society respects my racial identityy as gamer how do i do alternating days with 4 things a week thisis like that bodybuilding thread all over again it is so i do push/pull/legs/rest/push/pull/legs/rest... etc. i.e. i do different stuff on different days each week but i got my boi hiit in the mix on rest days i do cardio hiit so they aren't really rest days righto also good to do that the day after legs to loosen them up a bit im using circuits for that cus ye that's good too otherwise id never do it but its killer if theres only a few people who arent shit he ramps it up do yourself some crossfit pull ups like the little end thing he made us do was 100 pushups with shuttle runs every 10 oof ouch my shoulders yikes well, make sure you don't do push the day after that hmm im having a day now then maybe push legs pull but days inbetween yeah you can change the order hmmm doesn't really matter i'm loving the pull ups atm before i go on that video wanna get myself a wide boi back is that the dude that fucking like spins on the bar nah it's a dude who can do 100 "pull ups" and some weird crossfit cult egging him on while he flays around like a fish oh yeah thats the one i meant i couldnt think of any other way to describe it apart from spinning yeah tbf spinning is pretty accurate it's fucking awful my lats are non existent it makes me sad oh no not the lats back is bad i don't have wings i want wings like a bay bat how will you skim across the wate rnow ikr i'll have to run like a lizzarf lizzard woof you look like such an advanced excel user yeah pretty yellow lighting maybe i could get a job at ibm e? hang on im just trying to make my bar transparent :^) huh my free and open source taskbar wasnt accepting its transparency but i forced it into it with my powerful fingers i see nice what are you playin cs did you know if you take preworkout before bed you get gains in your sleep i think thats what active rest is oh and it helps you do a zyzz on your way out of course oh hell yeah of course e? soon watch the clip that i timestamped 🐸 in game 1 min e can't internets down rip o dear ive captured your essence there were no climbing emojis i was going to use a koala but i didnt think youd get it yes look at those awful android stickers >awful they are literally superior in every way possible no

2 knees when they do legs ye tear drops that's what they're called on fit because a tear drops once you see your gains? makes sense also strong is actually so good wtf i don't think i'd have actually stuck with it without it yes yeah it's pretty great right using it as we speak some of the ux is shit but it's definitely the best of the bunch can you send me the money for the tickets please sorry i told you i wasnt going ill see if i can sell it on facebook fuck i thought i had that picture of aaron handy ffs why does that auto caps i don't have it handy either it can tell how annoyed you are 😞 well lets just both imagine it ok go don't worry i came through you always do cum thru was looking for removal services on this scroll down to business and professional services look at some of the shit people are selling oh boy i cant wait to get my pubg coach that seems like a valuable use of my money 'fortnite pro gamer buddies' was my personal favourite playin cs? just about to o shit hurry up fam here’s an album for you… rocket league x monstercat vol. 1 by various artists thanks for that album will. how are the wife and kids. i have cataracts and will be blind soon. ffs i'm in a meeting and that was too funny to contain 👁🚫❌ rocket league tonight? actually enjoyed that last night been doing hanging leg raises for a few weeks do gifs not play inline what the fuck is that what fucking year is this i like ur phone btw who made it tim apple nice ive just thought of a joke you must be really good at sitting up now proud of that one wow what a great joke thanks i just thought of it because i just sat up nice and i felt like it was a more powerful movement then i was used to the classic comedy inspiration i just bumped in to some girl from tinder that i never ended up meeting up with it was super awkward and she text me after saying "you look way better in person btw" awks was she all like wow i bet he can sit up like a champ you should say "you look about the same" yeah, because she could see my abs through my skin tight hoodie yeah, i actually did lol gottem looks like you need to work on the most powerful muscle still the heart yikes oog yes oog fix that nerd neck good old athleanx damn now i'm going to squat like a machine tonight like what kind of machine? an ss machine of course you can goym those gains wc uhhh wc? wrong chet chat oh right i thought you were toilet memeing lol just pred on squat i channeled my inner nazi pretend that weight is your zyklon b you're lifting into the chamber games in a bit? ye i need one of them there fitness arm thingies what are good one guide me senpai an arm blaster? like a fitbit or whatever oh what do you want it for? like what do you want to track mostly heart rate to see dat fitness i guess calories? but im not really bothered about that i stopped tracking them on my fitness pal because i wasnt doing anything with it apart from just putting the stuff i ate in for no reaosn cool yeah tbh the most useful tracker to get is a wifi scale that's the most helpful thing i've got by a mile i have a fitbit alta hr which is the best one of the lot it's pretty small and tracks heart rate, sleep and steps battery lasts a whole week but i don't think it's that worth it tbh i'm thinking of getting rid of it going back to an apple watch because strong on apple watch is so fucking good kek well im not getting an apple watch maybe ill just not bother im not sure if its really worth it strong does a good job of tracking progress honestly just get a scale i've got an old one, but it doesn't do bodyfat it's just the weight one oh but im not after that weight loss yakno well then that aint worth it either i'd just go without any of it then what is your goal though? to not look like a giant baby and i guess something something good habits cus once i get that sweet inactive desk job i'll just become fat again if i don't do anything i see hmmm a fitbit might not be a bad idea then the steps are pretty good for that it's a good gauge of how active you are overall hr is only useful if you're doing intense cardio really or hiit /circuits thats sorta what made me think of it cus i was doing circuits today and found it way easier and im not sure if im actually fitter or if it was just easier it takes quite a while before your heartrate starts to change a more significant change will be recovery time i.e. if you're not as shattered after and if you can actually do shit the following day resting heart rate over time is ok but nothing to write home about i mean like i can see how hard im working based on heart rate right? maybe i made that up but it sounds true yeah you can that's walking to work in the morning walking home and going to the gym at the end so i should be able to see how much im doin if i keep track of that i guess im still not entirely confident of why i want this yep but it seems like an idea gitbit released this today it's their cheapest one with 24/7 heartrate nice ive got a 24/7 heartrate too top comment is great sorry second top >i've had dreams of rip yelling at me to finish who is rip is it rip torn mark rippetoe he's like a powerlifting guru is he the one with the giant gut yep he once was a beast e uhh gimmi like half an hour im training a ml model :^) its going to tell me if i have autism nice so tempted fuck just imagine how much more youll be able to lift aight game? ye i asked her why her wine glass stem was bent she said it was just that style of glass but you can literally see reality warping above her shoulder i bet she's fat searched for her on fb she is if fat girls put the amount of effort into getting skinner as they do into trying to hide their fatness i think the nhs would be able to balance its budget better wow that's fucking shocking form what a mong let's see a picture of her being fat if she lost weight she'd be so fit girls have it so fucking easy it infuriates me like all you have to do is not be fat pls i wanna see this fatness compared to the shopped photo i am out at the moment but once i return excellent or just search her on fb are you squashing squashing balls i am. what's her name screenshot you nonce oh did you find it nah help a brother out nah its easy yo harry and i are on cs if you're about aiee are you mid game nah about to start hurry up faggot rebootin cs? or other

don't think you'd heeb me ffs jewry that was on my laptop with someone present the old switcheroo was required i mean what do you expect really can you please set up monzo lending you money is the most painful thing in the world i think it would be beneficial for you to make it easier for me to lend you money given that i seem to do it all the time yeah i've considered it perhaps i will i want to die can i have your arm blaster if you do an hero or so you want to be posed with it at your funeral the latter obviously gotta show off them swans this thumbnail wtf images aren't sending on whatsapp atm weird yeah i noticed that so popular be the most popular person in your office do people really think like that i think so worryingly i've never met anyone and thought boy i'm so close to wanting to be their friend but they're just not interesting enough if only their card was made of a harder material that would push it over the edge hahaha i just assume anyone with one is an almighty cunt it's like £12 a month or something lol what the people that run revolut must be pissing themselves on the way to the bank £12.99 a month minimum 24 month contract so you're committed to 12.99 a month for two years absolutely fucking insane holy shit what it infuriates me that there are people out there with so much money that they pay for things like this 3 grand for having a metal card for 2 years imagine if that money was given to people that actually need it it's actually disgusting yes brother £300 for two years 🇷🇺🇷🇺 soon comrade oh only 300 that's so cheap then what a privilege i can now pick up my card with a magnet they're so kind and generous and humble very humble you don't even know how humble they are they have no way of showing it i'm sure they don't slap their card down as hard as possible to make sure people even hear that the sound waves it generates are superiort totally deffening anyone in the area my fellow of colour gimmi a food huh food name a dish hmmm chilli or cottage pie i like that however i am going to make burritos instead but thank you for your effort nice yall playing them video games? will be on in a sec i'm on now i think mac runs this channel buff dudes kek yo we on cs my broksi nice i hope you have fun ok kek ill be on in a game or two 😎 nigga you mid game? yes hmu when ur done kk we're on 10-4 oscar mike e ? hmm perhaps in a bit im pushing and food and bathe iight take ur sweet tim sorry im busy buying targeted facebook advertising clothing hahahahahaha please buy that whats that shitty film filter thing you use called i need to use it *ironically* nice huji what a fucking aids name you gotta pay to use it on saved images though lol fuk that ima find an apk oh yeah android lol e ? just gotta kill 10 more bosses wut idle game o you playin cs just chilling am i doomed to eternal sore legs nah it'll fade although not if you're squatting loads that'll take a while oh dang well i'm doing lots of squatting every third day so maybe once i plateau yeah you should be okay plus you're not doing it with a barbell so it shouldn't be as bad cause the weight is more consistently located centrally i mean there's less variance so you don't end up using your core or unevenly using one leg or a certain muscle that inconsistency makes doms after squatting with a barbell relentless until your form is perfect every time who is dom which it never is really delayed onset muscle soreness damn doms anyway my core is thick like tree it turns out being skinny means i can skip those months you spent losing the weight in the first place ballin i thought you said doms doms for a sec which would've been funny yep jammy git means you're probably a hard gainer tho so you'll have to eat loads to gain muscle rip you oh no how awful it's worse than it sounds trust me get back to me when you can't put on muscle and you're eating a painful amount of protein every day mmmmm so much tuna and chicken 8 meaps every day because my metabolism is good mmm sounds awful i don't wanna get big like a bull anyway more like a fast chicken ya but unfortunately you'll still need to build muscle my dude much like the tasty chicken which must build muscle to become succulent and jewsy like i shall i forgot that its actually good thank you for that screencap pre workouts have a bad name because people take stupid shit without knowing what it does like 1-3 dymeth and then people die it's just natural selection basically it's fine but thats just like what bananas have it's just another type of bcaa makes you strong and shit and how can you argue with that impossible i wonder if i should do ket swings with legs guide me darth hmmm or just more squats and lunges either do it on legs or pull i find that kettlebell swings fuck up my lats and my core more than my legs although they do fuck up my glutes hmmmm i think they can stay on pull cus if my legs are tired when im swinging around a bunch of weight is bad i'd probably do it at the end of legs actually pull is just before legs yeah keep it on pull and tbh your squats are probably pretty light atm so working your glutes the day before probably aint bad they are i dont have enough mass i need more mass these are great have you not watched them before? nope oh dang youll love em "your non poon hand" i need curls so i can get better at pointing at myself this one is also great theyre all just goot shit watch em all i hope thats said without sarcasm ofc you on? i'm browsing reddit bored out of my tits i can be im pretty much doing the same just join disc not windows i aint playing gams atm aight i'll try and get it working then what a unit b i g c h u n g u s hey they're p good spring tunes for this sunny spring copy that got a big old case of the doms today i can feel the little furry bois pls don't reference the new flat in that chat aaron is in there and he doesn't know i'm moving yet i was waiting for you to tell me that hahaha thats why it was vague and nonsensical good everything you say is vague and nonsensical exactly everyone would just assume i was being weird apart from you the perfect ruse i wanna start a podcast and i want you to be on it and i don't mean in the conventional sense like not structured really interesting so you want me to ramble yes but i think we'd need some good topics like the sort of things that come up in our normal conversations but themed somehow and we'd want someone else on it every time a guest basically i dont know that many people more than 2 and one of them is you maybe you could be a host and guest i know plenty of people ayylmao what are some good topics? wow ok green around town well its a pod cast right so we should talk about nu metal good more of that please ive perhaps thought of a good way to perhaps make being vague about the cafe work get rid of the job role make it a single line that says something like various duties but with more words gimmi them hot takes yes that sounds like a good idea e? off to the pub my baahabhiat if youre still on later yeah np i'll go gym lols i'll be on later you should do some kipping pullups i hear momentum is a key part of muscle growth joint damage* oh no my weed yes look at the fucking image that comes up who would look at that and think yeah that seems like a sensible exersisce can you just prefix anything with "kipping" to imply that it's wrong? i'm going to make that a thing i love my kipping squats using a allah trapbar wtf is it called a trap bar because it looks like an animal trap idk google it idk the origin nope its named after ya traps i cant wait until youve sent enough pictures of yourself so i can make a yu gi oh forbidden one out of you hahaha you're missing left arm and left leg im sure youll provide sooner or later also finding a non shit email is impossible should i make a website just to have a not shitty email maybe see what domain you can get whats that thing you use huh for checkin domains domainr aids name pretty long sorry we cant all be born with short names hey gregleonard.app get* is that a joke no or .org or even better .gov gregleonard.gov no im going to get .io because its like my power button how do i shorten my last name will greg-l e? bill plates ye do you play the game ye ok i join r u in game kk in discord fam no i'm on rocket league harry ain't on 🐎 wow that's a great emoji under used isn't it just i'm a big fan of it it's so detailed do you remember me mentioning we had one of those weird kneeling chairs at home when i was younger? my dad just sent me a photo of me sat on it w i d e b o i why was your dad filming a skate video in your house ffs why is it so low res i wanna see what you're looking at hahahaha hahahahaha that was good i liked that it's like 2004/5 or something what do you expect think i'm like 10 maybe it's higher resolution if i forward it rather than copying it ? also, here's my old room it's amazing ring ding ding baybee hahahaha there's a photo of my sister's room which is even better but i doubt you'll find it funny because you don't know her that's probably likely cool airsoft gun though she had lot of stuff basically she was a horder wow that's horiffic i feel claustrophic just looking at that ikr so bad you should add this to your gym playlist youll be lifting to the moon oh hell yeah i only listen to metal on leg day cause my legs are metal the name will be obvious when you see 1 >eletronic gym more like how to fall asleep while squatting: the playlist i've renamed it to that but i now need a matching name for the metal one you should probably just watch metalocalypse and steal something from that hmu when youre in the lobby will do will be on in 5 flat has fallen through though so am currently frantically looking for flats o shit nigga was it the wind did it blow over agencies are the worst i wish it fucking blew over how can an agency fuck it up lel they failed to get the hmo license and now they don't have time before the move in date wow how incompetent will explain on discord isnt that literally what youre giving them your money for yep pretty much fairly sure we can sue them because it's likely going to cost us money you should then use that money to get an even nicer flat everyone wins i decided to switch up core and include some hollow holds cus it seemed like the meme core on fit me before & after: hollow holds? i do hanging leg raises, hanging knee raises, laying leg raises, crunches, cross crunches, ab wheel, extended plank lay on ya back and stick your arms and legs out its killer you should try it i dont think that dude is doing it totally right damn son there you go looks brutal just turn your back into a wiggle curve i'll try it later at the gym ez currently going to viewing after viewing that sounds fucking awful any potentials yet yeah just saw one that's nice about to put an offer in link my up my flibba will later calling now to offer i have 100 messages on spareroom about available places carnage shit son sounds intense you should have a big ol cup of coffee you quell your anxiety i've been caffeine free for two weeks to help my anxiety so i can't imagine it would have that effect i thought you had preworkout i stopped taking it made me to anxious caffeine seems to make it a lot worse i've discovered yeah it does thats why i drink it all the time if im constantly at a high level of anxiety it means it becomes normal and i cant ever be anxious 9d chess my dude you on discord? just got back i can be grant and i hoping on cs oh right i wasnt gunna play games maybe later wanna chill on disc ? will be on in 15 ye im having dinner in a min but after just db pressed 22s for the first time ya boi is growing boobs wow thanks what a horrific image lol 44kg for 10 hell fucking yeah soon you will be like athleany becus youre not quite x it's the chromosomes isn't it is this you seent it but i appreciate the reference and yes i have more than you faggot that's where you're getting the tard strength from channeling the chromosomes directly into my muscle they're all rattling around in my chest you can get em all in your chromodex i'm on when you're about fyi ye i got caught up with all these leaves in this tree house geddit yes i found this property on the rightmove android app and wanted you to see it: http://www.rightmove.co.uk/s6p/69525841 check out my routine 'legs' on strong. check out my routine 'pull' on strong. check out my routine 'push' on strong. wow what password manager do you use 1password wow chris chan senpai ive discovered a life hack if the things i lift are heavier it takes less time to do exercise http://i.imgur.com/njauckv.gif wow has it really taken you this long to realise that jesus christ that's why people squat, bench and deadlift 3*3 high weight quick 30 min gym session every other day bob's your uncle hahahahaha wtf b-b-but my functional strength is that guy doing compound lifts are functional i have no idea what functional even is surely making yourself stronger in any way makes day to day actions easier mhm functional just means doing movements that your body is designed to do i think so it does broadly mean anything but it also depends what you yourself do like, rugby players functional training is different to footballers i think that's the general idea we're on pubg btw pete and rob o hecc i shall join you were right i should buy more weights i decided not to be lazy and do one arm at a time for my curls n shit and used 10 instead of 5 now i can feel the gains brewing like a satisfying shit of muscle you were curling 5kg? that's nothing kek ikr i was just being lazy what dumbbell were you holding when you were squatting? cus i didnt have 2 of more 15 its all i can fit on it :( that's not too awful but like, i'm not very strong and i squat 80kg 10 reps * 3 so you can definitely squat like 50-60kg at least you're missing out on them gains but that means buying hella weight which is an issue just get a barbell just gotta find that jackpot of some clueless woman giving away a whole bunch of weight cus she doesnt want it around and then buy like 2 *15kg plates that's all you'd need for deadlifting and squatting cause a barbell is 20kg on its own so 2 plates is 50kg quik maff then you can just do higher and higher volume as you get stronger or buy some extra plates if you need them later on the main problem is having a rack ye you need something to hold the bar at head height maybe just buy a really heave dumbell sorry, kettlebell aw hell yeah fucking hell that would be hilarious just get one of the small free standing ones that fold up can probably get one of those second hand for like £20 or something similar then all you need is a barbell and probably a bench i doubt my little piano stool can hold like 120kg yeah maybe up to you, depends how heavy you plan on going i wouldn't bench on your own though with a barbell you need a spotter really i'd stick to dumbbells if you're lifting on your own aight i mean, you could bench on your own if you had a smith machine that's basically the whole point of them but then who knows how much ill be lifting its like lifting on the moon theres no gravity but they're fucking huge and heavy, you'd need some sort of crane to get it to your house probably smith machines are ridiculous someone will be selling some tasty weights for almost nothing somewhere then i can jack up my dumbells yeah, if not just wait for them to pop up also this dude is basically giving these away a new one is 60 quid from amazon for 24kg i'm selling a kettlebell and my dumbbells atm on gumtree not that it would help you need to get rid of them by the end of the week whats ya bell, boi 16kg fascinating i think you'd struggle to carry it home thanks hahaha i mean, you could but it would be fucking knackeringh maybe in your backpack tbf im not gunna like fucking curl it home im gunna have a bag hahahaha you fucking plebian i think dumbells are the way to go but you need to curl for the girls yeah, kettlebells are only good for swings god my stablisers are gunna be so fucking stable dumbbells and a barbell are what you need imo you could just get more plates for your dumbbells yeah im gunna get more plates either way and squat that cus theyre all m o d u l a r ill just find heavy objects with known weights and lift them up and down yeah just go full strongman and find some giant heavy rocks and press them over your head or maybe even some logs maybe ill just do an aki find some young men squeeze their biceps a bit then squat em hell yeah squat me senpai i'm probably about your 1rm uguuu~~~ i think im probably my own 1rm if only you could clone yourself and then squat other you imagine the synergy my god look at this shit someones selling hahahaha what people will try and sell anything won't they my box of gains has arrived pull up bar? ya boi sorry its a door gym. not a pull up bar hahahaha a door gym wow jesus that's a lesson in marketing right there i cant find the door smith machine damn son that's all you need what was that thing you said to do is it just hanging leg raises hanging leg raises, but you probably will only be able to do a few i suspect so progress down to hanging knee raises then do chin ups and pull ups. and do some pull ups with a supernated grip i.e. rotated 90 degrees like a hammer curl aight ill save them ones for pull doin push atm do knee/leg raises every day they're so good also great for your grip strength yeah i do core stuff every day anyway should i do floor ones too because you're hanging from the bar for ages or just chuck em i do 4*12 and do hangs i do the floor ones after hangs i do leg raises to failure then knee raises to failure then laying leg raises progress down from hanging leg raises then as yo get stronger you'll be able to see how many leg raises you can do do you do like sets to failure or just one until you cant do no mo sets to failure sets of 12 aight how do i stop myself from swinging like a fucking top engadget your core thats a very autistic auto suggestion there control yourself up and down slowly don't swing i was just looking up how to graip the bar why the fuck is that dudes head so small he looks like hes wearing a man suit hahaha that's amazing looks like a chimp amazing i was hanging wrong anyway kek ah hmmm maybe that would be it i cant just hang from it legs down cus i just touch the floor hmmm maybe try leg raises or try and fix it higher up somewhere garage door maybe ive found a solution ive just gotta hold a chin up all my doors are the same height that works wtf why is it so hard you'll struggle to do that at the end of pull the top my my legs hurt now i couldn't do a single leg raise when i started they're hard that's why they're good ive done 2 sets of 12 fine i think i can finish it already alright* leg raises or knee raises? leg impressive are your legs straight nah theyre flaming and are you controlling then on the way down? yeah pointy like a ballerina and yeah i was making sure i was going slow so i didnt end up swinging damn son if you can do 3 sets of 12 leg raises i'll be super impressed maybe you have really light legs well you have a smaller uhhh moment? or bigger i cant remember ive done 3 mostly its just making the front of my thighs hurt moment huh weird never had that something to do with movement in physics i cant remember thats all i ever learnt well the diagram of muscle man has the front of his legs red so i guess his must be sore too you should try to front lever google it all these pictures are sideways kek also this is fucking killing my arms i think theyll give out way before my core it's very hard yeah, mine do normally but climbing helps that have you done any squirrel push ups yet wtf is that i do diamonds and clapping push ups get them type 2 fibres boi i have no idea what theyre actually called but thoe things he does on the treadmill is that an actual thing? i think they're meant to be plank push ups they're really hard so no i can't even l sit let alone do something while l sitting is that why youve got a standing desk i'm not done sort of gymnast some* yes i think im gunna give up on the hanging now ive done 2 sets of knees but my arms feel like im going to cause them actual harm at least my forearms gunna be like that fucking cauliflower mans ones i can do like 10 sets of knee raises but only two sets of leg raises i'm impressed got them short legs init yours get exponentially heavier by the time you reach your feet its like lifting another whole of yourself true and my hamstrings are so tight it makes them borderline impossible like fucking pulled rubberbands maybe you should do some flexability stuff in case you turn into a castle bradberry or whatever the fuck his name is brad castleberry i just always think he looks like hes made of random stones like a castle sprinting constantly like a castle i'll be on discord soon im going out at 7ish but ill be back later also im doing flat leg raises and its actual effort now fuk u why you gotta make me do hard work ight you should be sweating and exhausted at the end of every workout and your core should ache the next day or you're not trying hard enough so, good... i thought i was cus im always a sweaty boi but i think that was just because i was doing a million light reps its was uhhh intentional fatburning i was laying the concrete to build the house of my muscles on a fleshy bloody house tbf i was the same when i started >the asian thumb have to up the weight pretty quick my response hahahaha it gets better negroid fuck im using that hahahahahaha i'm actually crying i can't believe she typed out negroid im in

probably lost more fat proportionally too also, time of day makes a big difference so make sure you weigh yourself every morning my weight fluctuates by like 1.4kg in a day oh but some days i have my morning shit and others i dont have time hmmm maybe i should just weigh myself pre and post shit on the days i dont when i have my shit later in the day and subtract the weight of my shit from the morning weigh lol hhaha yeah im joking just a funny joke can you achieve single colour man hahaha ya bois quads getting stronger nice theyll be septs soon yes discord? soon dope the jeans oh i thought this was on the streme but no it was actually targeted specifically at me great 😑♥ advice senpai my pull is gunna take like 2 hours now what do do i just have to lift heavier things yes all your workouts should take about 45 minutes reduce rest time between sets to 30 seconds too unless you're lifting much heavier then go for 1 min rests aight cool i can do everything heavier apart from dumbell deadlifts is there any point in even doing them if i'm only lifting 5 in each 5kg? ye ain't got enough weights for more instead i'm doing like 100 yeah, not worth it like a piston i deadlift 80kg 10*3 or near that 2400 deadlift should be your heaviest lift wow i know it should be but yaknoen what's this hmmmm ya boi has a flat thank the lord o hecc negronio what where and i managed to get

like mailbox or inbox which are the two email clients everyone loves but got discontinued after being acquired you swipe each way to archive etc incentives you to get down to zero >incentives to get down to zero wow i'd just create a new address at that point you look smaller now like someone has vacuumed you but on the inside it makes your hair look much bigger in comparison like i've been vacuum packed? my hair also needs to be cut... so that probably doesn't help no like every time youve had a dom sneak inside you hes brought one of those hand held vaccum things so i look skinny basically? or like tight i hate that youve used that word to describe yourself skinny? or tight? lmao obviously tight it just makes me imagine youu breathing in too much and all your skin ripping off because its on so fucking tight like the opposite of the hulk i'm so small that i implode not exactly imploding youre like a cheese that the skin they made for it turned out too small but they put it on anyway so the slightest hole and itll pop like a balloon that's good probably means i've lost bodyfat and got more toned 🔥 soon youll be finding any excuse to pop that top off hell ye just gotta get rid of my stretch marks now and get a tan so i don't look like a ghost i cant wait until you get a tan im going to mock you endlessly relentlessly* excellent no change there then... i know but for

have biceps hahahaha true you fucking brainlet i suppose lots of animals have biceps like do centipedes have biceps? lots of little biceps yes yes they do its really difficult to get all those little barbells though so they always have tiny arms ahh yeah, that makes sense if only there was a decent manufacturer of small barbells then the world would be blessed with yolked centipedes im sensing startup idea this is an entirely untapped market it needs a catchy name i got nothin bicepede but theyre already called cent which is a bigger number centeps bicentennial pede i've been trying to find a picture of a hench centipede but i'm having no luck i tried looking but i really dont enjoy looking at centipedes creepy devil insects yeah they're pretty grim i was looking too and there was one that was especially gross with really long legs i thought they all had short legs which made them look innocent but some of them almost like look cats cats my bretherin hast thou ever seen a cat apparently not i hear they have many pairs of legs yes two the be precise i wonder how many is many who knows i don't think they even know ey we on cs you coming ? i'm out my dude, maybe if you're on

get my fucking hench squat on also signed up to a new gym that has 5 squat racks gunna get them huge quads init look at this hench ass steak our hob is induction... and it's actually really fucking good i mean compared to your old hob anything would be better if you start cooking properly you'll grt annoyed with it though yeah it's annoying if you wanna spread oil around the pan cause when you lift it off it stops heating it but it's really fucking hot it'll be more temperature control that gets ya cus it takes a bit for it to heat up or down ye gets to temperature so quick though and our oven is beastly "4d fan oven" what's the fourth dimension also is it magnetic induction or xbox 360 red ring idk tbh magnetic i guess? they things don't actually get hot noice them ones are pretty hench hell ye btw you should get a sous vide machine for your steak takes it to the next level wtf is that i just got a rice cooker arrived today buzzed to try it just ordered 20kg of rice for £15 lol damn son you're gunna make hella rice now gunna be great chicken and rice erryday let's hope i don't kill myself get ur seasonings going n you'll be set what seasonings shall i get fam teach a man to cook c o o k easiest way to make chicken tasty get a lemon and lime squeeze em out butterfly the chicken breast lemon is out fam leave it to sit in the juice for half an hour at least before you cook it eat wat lemon me skin bad you don't rub it on your skin lips numb suffocation no breathing ok well that's very sad it's like we're doing def poetry like charlie and dee that's the most delicious was of cooking chicken what about that nandos marinade stuff no you can make your own way easier well tell me senpai ill find you a good recipie also salt n pepper chicken n is peng hell yeah had shit loads of salt and pepper ont he steak last night was great remember to salt your meat as far in advance as possibl i need to get some proper salt i've got shitty fine stuff atm grim rock/seasalt + grinder and you're set also don't be scared of your chicken yeah, i'm gunna get some grinders i think so many people cook it to death because they're scared of getting something and it turns into disgusting rubber yeah i have that problem get a meat probe i got a new pan it's a fucking beast cook it to temperature tefal disgusting a meat probe? i'll probe ur meat but better than what you've got pls nigga there's so many which one just look for most good reviews in your price range they're all basically the same nah fuck that get a digital one yup i was just about to send you that boom ordered now i need grinders and salt hook me up everyone raves about himalayan salt should i get that? no its a meme salt n pepper grinders are harder cus you need to spend more cheap ones are ok but theyll all be plastic inside so you wanna find some nice metal ones and theyll last forever what, himalayan salt? like activated almonds? yeah its pink so people fawn over it i see but its just less pure rock salt wtf fuck there's so many options help im on it these look good theyre tall though or these also look fine both say theyre ceramic and metal so no weird plastic flavour absorbing going on i like them tall ones ye makes you feel like a proper chef and makes your pp enormous ordered now salt and pepper ofc salts easy and so is pepper get the cheapest peppercorns and rock salt maybe i should just buy it from an actual shop black pepperscorns seems weird ordering it off amazon none of that mixed shit probably cheaper off amazon and they dont goym you with only getting a tiny amount none of it is on prime ??? fak salt link me the pepper fam 750 grams seems excessive type in pepper why then you dont have to go out and buy more that's a heck of a lot of pepper just refill it is that salt not on prime for you i mean you can just get salt in a shop tbh yeah i found that other one just ordered 1kg of black peppercorns and 1.5kg of rock salt ayy itll last forevere was like £15 total ye in the current flat for at least a year so all good noice just dont keep it anywhere that might have moisture ye i'll make sure i fix it shut properly with a peg right, any other cooking essentials? oils youve got the coconut one coconut oil init but i would reccomend olive because coconut oil doesnt always suit the taste got some olive oil i think make sure you have some nice impliments get yourself a good nice knife and learn how to use it and an iron and learn to use that too or if youre feeling fancy a whetstone got good knifes an iron? wut what knives have you got if its any of the ones ive used at yours you dont nope adam and kirby have a bunch of nice kinfes knifes* they're pretty good sharp big excellent meant a steel knife sharpening rod thing also watch this french man ah we got one of them ayy yeah i figured if they had good knives theyd have one get em to show you then and youll be set dope how do you cook your veg? depends what youre making my man carrots, broccoli, cauliflower what just for on the side? to go with rice and whatever meat ya oh right obvs will cook in a pan with other stuff if youre just doing that microwave em mixed in but in isolation hmmm can you do that with frozen veg? yeah dope i do it all the time proper steaming is effort boiling takes ages is there anywhere you can buy frozen veg in bulk? guess you can't get it on amazon i dunno actually they do that grocery thing maybe they have food trucks got a £20 limit cba to hit that eh just get it from a shop ya will do that tomorrow dope i got some tupperware gunna prep my foods id recommend getting separate frozen veg cus if you wanna make something that includes one of them you can use it ya but apart from peas and sweetcorn youd be better off doing it fresh if youre making an actual dish so its ehh how do you cook sweet potatoes well? in a pan? diced up just to mix in? depends how you want them really to have them on the side with a steak or something lil bit crispy oh right nah and easier way of doing that is cut em into chip shape or whatever you want microwave them and drain the water cover in oil and salt/pepper stick em in the oven then you can do the steak while theyre crisping up *you dont have to microwave but it makes them cook so much faster and makes em more fluffy inside dope sounds great will try that tomorrow pat em dry with some kitchen roll or something before you oil them and oil and season them in a bowl so they get covered and you dont use up loads of oil and dont use coconut oil kk or if youre feeling extra fancy get yourself a stick of unsalted butter and use that should i get a brush for oiling shit you dont need it for oiling everyday stuff it couldnt hurt to have one if youre doing something with pastry but i rarely use mine okay cool will skip that then and now that youve got a balcony you should start growing your own herbs lmao h e r b s 'erb im not joking btw grow some herbs i'm going to change my programming at the gym focus on compound lifts more eat more food get stronger like wut basil, parsley, mint, thyme, oregano, chives mint and chives are impossible to kill the rest require a bit of maintenance but you get that extra bonus of cooking for a girl and being all i just need to get some herbs from my plant hmmm h 🌿e🌿r🌿b nice could b u don't have anywhere for plants really would need some pots ye but they'd look a bit outta' place have you got a morrisons around you mmm yeah, i think so they sell off their excess plant pots here at least you can get 9 decent sized ones for 99 p its gr8 and you can just get the shop herbs that are already grown and put them into good sized pots hmmm i shall enquire there's an ikea round the corner from our place which is really fucking convenient going to buy some plants from there i think fake plants? mix i sorta feel like real plants that you cant eat are pretty poinltess pointless depends i think it's nice to have one or two to look after but anything more than that is just annoying but you can just replace them with something you can eat then it has a purpose to be eaten... what an existence they love it gotta spread that seed somehow gross ya boi is pumped to not live in the middle of a city and to have fresh air and hear birds every time you eat a tomato its just spoodging all over the inside of your mouth and have a

spinny chair they can all bid for me turn towards each as they talk or maybe i'll get a chicken, cut its head off and then let it run on a twister board and whatever colour it lands on and they have the option of activating the brake built into the chair equates to a company if they want more time with you but it costs them money per newton of force applied to the brake ofc nice maybe a combined

i'll feather ur mum leg raises are great my shoulder is still fucked from that one arm pullup attempt what a terrible idea that was leg raises are awful i need to get some of those autistic ankle weights like connor had so i dont have to do as many i don't understand why you're so good at them nah it was a good idea you should do the other one for symmetry it's so weird those short skinny legs of yours >skinny nah bruh thicc like a scaled down rugby player you're like the dude on the front of the door gym box who wasn't scaled with his aspect ratio locked exactly i wish i had that weird picture of jack right now so i could squish it and make him look even longer id like to do the opposite make him regularly proportioned brilliant ive done hanging ones now i have to do floor ones fucking end myself id honestly just rather do planks forever and i fucking detest planks planks are terrible i've ditched them from my program my athlean shat all over them but my bodybuilding forums said they were good no rotational stability it's like using a smith machine to squat fit said i should get a little wheel with handles on yep they're great and then they mocked said wheel because it looks like something you stick up your arse and spin on like a top yeah exactly can i just use a skateboard thats more gnarly the bibbas on reddit say you need to have a reasonable core already otherwise u fuk urself and that i should do hollow holds why doesnt anyone agree on anything you could totally use a skateboard "the wheelill" wow wheelpill* yeah, ab wheels are really hard but if you can do leg raises, you'll be fine i think i'm going to get a polar heart rate monitor so i can to proper interval training nice do your gym get cold does* no ... oh i thought you meant like polar bears theyre actually called activity trackers wut polar bear watch i'm so confused i'm not getting this joke at all polar heart rate polar cold gym cold ha ha comedy bazinga hahahahaha wow you should put that on 4chan please it actually works really well i have no idea how many i should actually do and i will you've gotta take all the weights of your db before tho which is long nah it works out

oh shit is your brain a siv you could literally be referring to anyone as "the nutter" i mean i thought he made a lasting impact on you i guess not ive not even seen him in my sleep hahaha updating hinge i like it i feel like it will spark some thought-provoking conversations fry your asparagus weird nah you literally always get fried asparagus with steak hmmm i did it in the microwave with some water in bundles wrapped in kitchen roll it's what the internet said they tasted good microwave and kitchen foil eh kitchen roll i mean you can do them in a n microwave not foil... but it's not as flavoursome do you fry them with water? aren't you meant to hydrate them a bit? i thought frying them would make them super dry what no they're stuffed with water also you don't dry fry them everything online said either steam or put them in the microwave with some water you do it with the butter and juices from you streak i see mmmmm that does sound good check out the gamer behind her we live in a society hahaha e ? c o n t e n t fuck that's legit the best one i've seen wait for the bee hive quote fuck i can't believe that's real s e m e n c r u s t e d semen crusted bees my entire body never stops being slightly to rather sore what am i doing wrong greenpai should i roll myself on a roll squash all that sore out yes and eat more protein maybe ill fukkin drink more protein yes you should be on at least like 150g of protein a day which one are you on now is it the big bulk powders oh er no i get optimum nutrition i got myprotein in the past it's all pretty much the same just make sure it's a whey isolate i know you do but what sthe brand i.e. it doesn't have a load of other shit in it huehue basically just get the highest protein to calorie ratio optimum nutrition is the best for that i think but it's a little bit more expensive that myprotein or bulkpowders i've also heard recently that it's good to mix whey, casein and vegan protein whey can fuck up your stomach if you have loads nice i can be the first natty vegan bodybuilder if you have any problems with lactose also, don't have it with milk nah just have it with water lactose aint nose problem unless you wanna put on shit loads of weight have it with water hell ye also make sure it has a good amino acid profile. some of them are shit you need all essential amino acids do just get bog standard whey none of the fancy shit like bcaa it's all bollocks which of the amino acids are essential she's like a female chris wtf is that lmfao i sure hope you watched to the end cunt erm straight in there at 11:30 whats a gege hahaha i think it's meant to be "hehe" also theres literally nothing hotter than a girl saying "wanking ur cock" but 🤷‍♂ she has a way with words hahahaha ikr what the fuck it's the least sexy thing to say ever will thou'st wanketh mein cockith hahaha should i say that see what she says yeah for sure jesus why do these fucking behemoths like me and another she literally looks

wtaf nutter sounds like your type my man congratulations you should hunt her down on fb you're on reddit lmfao maybe it was just a catfish all along i think potentially i asked her to send a picture of her with something in it to prove she wasn't catfishing and it took a few messages after that before she blocked me so i think it's highly likely that was the caeeb cass* case* what a scumbag i hope he or she is arrested rip wills pp lol no pp sent thankfully oof as long as you didnt include face and used a neutral wall neutral wall? what does that even mean? i just sent her a normally photo that i took in the bathroom at work some people have identifying walls probably one that i've sent to you at some point no pp identifying walls? like identify as male? no you fucking sexist they identify as whatever they want ofc they identify as walls mainly do you ever have monent where you wish you were gay like i'd quite happily just fucking move in to the middle of the woods somewhere and live with another man forever if i wanted to fuck him but alas that sounds horrific its unfortunate isnt it i swear being gay would be so fucking easy i know in some places it would be literally the worst but youre stuck being an inferior straight faggot but in the western world it would be so fucking easy they're all so entitled fucking gays and their happiness how would flagpolling eachother work? swish that meat between your legs like dogs when they go butt to butt wut i'm very confused gigity look up dogs getting stuck after sex ffs not now ok ill draw it for you oh god pls no it looks a lot like this why does that resemble a flagpole? i don't  understand oh my small minded friend just flip turn that image 90 heat units and place the ground level at about mid peen height i still don't understand there's nothing flagpole about that it's just a double ended dildo between two dogs did you know that a rusty trombone doesnt include a *real* trombone wut sex acts arent always explicitly described use your imagination you fucking autist but it doesn't even slightly look like a flagpole like not even close it's just oh will you anger me will two dogs with a dildo between them how is that a flagpole stop trying to make flagpoles our of spitroasts, greg. you make me angry greg. jesus christ that's a fucking big stretch welcome to the world of gay sex thanks i'm going to leave that world now ty you were a good gay for all of 10 minutes now i'm definitely straight and i will be forever lmfao cis scum what are you even doing are you at a party shouldnt you be looking for an excuse to pop that top off i'm at a wedding i'm desperate to pop the top off i vehemently hate that song im trying to think of a word that expresses my disgust even more than that i hope i find one according to cambridge dictionary thesaurus these are my options i unqenchably hate that song i prefer inexpressibley and i know. that's why it made me think of you and your hatrid what was the first dance song get lucky by daft punk ??? are you joking yes i think it was george michael or something i wasn't in the room urgh or duran duran maybe what would your first dance be? lol obviously it would be self loathing by suburban scum so i can fukkin windmill that audience into the ground fuck i need some arm extendors extenders imagine it a windmill of biblical proportions id take off wait no ive though of an even better band literally anything by deez butz nutz hustle in life hustle at the wedding is that the number of listens on the right? or the length of the song? i hope for the latter yes theyre still recording it great then i approve i've decided we should go on some adventures in your car over the summer on the south coast its 874 solid days of hardcore i hope you're okay with this i dont think i have a choice but ok thank you for having a car senpai excellent dont thank me thank accountancy and its dismally dull but reliable income thank you f35 thank you for your silent, efficient, undetectable by radar killing no no no you enable me to leach of my friend's parent's income all he did was balance the books like a seesaw maybe in an indirect way hes killed some people ah that's okay then e t h e i c a l yes i guess we all have lovely extra e nice paying taxes that go to the man yeah we all kill people i'm in a sleeping bag that end up as missles shot at sand penguins that's down think of all the ducks i just killed bloody rag heads cant ducks regrow feathers negroids yeah but not if they're killed before their current set of feathers are plucked i mean yeah youre not wrong there that would be handy if they kept growing feathers after death you could stuff an empty sleeping bag cover with dead ducks yeah and in a few hours it would be full of tasty down peng no will mallards yes what flavour flav is your way im gunna buy some im literally sore all the time its so fucking annoying the one you had was on vanilla but i normally get double chocolate both are great vanilla is my jam ye get the on one it's the best vanilla flavour did you get it off amazon and it's really good isolate yeah what the huge thicc one amazon is cheapest by far i got the tub but recently got the giant bag cause it's cheaper but if you're not sure if you'll have it that frequently just get a tub vanilla ice cream? errr think it's just called vanilla one sec doesnt exist on amazon unless i am tard that's the one i got on right the creme lol wtf i can get delivery for today how the fuck do they do that wait do i need a shakey boi fuck sake damn son yeah you need a shakey boi or get a nutribullet so you can use it for other shit too like fruit and berries etc wtf is a nutribullet google it sounds like one of those things you rub on your clit but a really vitamin rich version yep rub your nutribullet on your clit greg you'll be so fucking healthy it's just a fucking blender pretty much a really good one tho and the things for it double i as a bottle do you don't clean up loads of shit after i might get one to replace that huge one lol you can get some off brand one for way cheaper you and your meme brands google they're way better than the shit cheap ones there's a reason everyone loves them you infuriate me with your bad purchasing decisions like buying an android phone or fashioning an ab wheel from a skateboard ohhhh it's a nutibullet it's like someone literally shooting you in the face with nutrition yep instantly absorbed let me just load up my nutri gun with this nutri bullet fill that nutri magazine you'll be nutrifull before long you nitro cunt hahahaha nitro cunt love it look this one comes with a little compartment to keep your completely legal enhancers in apparently i sleep like this like some sort of mad chicken do you have that thing like walt jr hahaha osteoporosis it me it must have been nice airbed with no holes literally my dream dreamy indeed one day well you've got sofas now true they aren't inflatable my dad has just started unironically using the black thumbs up what a negroninio yes whey wheys like nothing should i drink 5 a day then to get that 125g i only have one a day unless i have something light for dinner then i might have a second just use it to hit your macros but don't rely on it over actual food oh yeah i should probably know what my macros are is 1 scoop = 1 macro? mhm how many macros do i need to hit probably like 10 or something right depends what your goal is to be aesthetic af nice probably like 150g protein then the rest will be like 60% carb 40% fat but i bet your calories are low as shit for maintenence so you'll basically be like 75% protein t-the short man w-wins again! you c-cuck ye im going to be made of 75% protein? yes you'll be a walking talking piece of meat i already am we all are will i wonder how much weight all the proteins take up in a body also i wish there was some way to combine every single different lift i have to do into some kind of enormous single rep hahaha that's called compound exercises if you went to a proper gym you could just go in, so five heavier sets of bench then go home go in two days later do 5 heavy sets of deadlifts go home go in two days later do five heavy sets of squats go home christ i should buy a barbell fucking hell people are stupid should i get casein as well for that night protein i bet my farts are going to be monsterous depends if you're okay with dairy or not casein fucks me up and then i can't sleep i think so? ive never noticed anything from any kind of dairy i normally just have whey or collagen before bed if you have a high protein dinner that should be fine i do not casein might be a good shout then adam and i both hate casein we just have whey ill see how whey does for a few days some people swear by it though you can get whey/casein blends too if i end up like pall plart mall fart ill maybe not have casein btw you should be having  a decent amount of carbs for breakfast if you aren't already have oats or something whey won't make you fat sorry i do intermittent fasting it's really low in calories and fills you up just like bone broth it'll make you lose weight if anything mm so nice mmm delicious flavour water i seent it god the bodybuilding fourms are full of some absolute fucking brainlets 1cb/1lb ? centi beter? im just reading about caesin and whey and almost every post reads like a broscience video chickenbreast 1 chicken breast per lb of bodyweight per day obviously ah yes delicious flavourless bodybuilding chicken mmmmmm so nice bodybuilding fourms reckon to have whey in the morning can i made some kind of enourmous coffee with whey yeah people do add whey to coffee actually i think i read about it somewhere yeah, i have whey every morning i make one of those breakfast smoothies i dont want to drink a pint of coffee though raspberries, blueberries, a banana, oats, 1 scoop of whey, 1 scoop of creatine and 150ml of water just have a shake and a coffee you can drink a shake with a scoop of protien in it in like 10 seconds they're so easy to get down hmmm possible also im totally not going to bothere with a shaker i just mixed it up with a fork and now i dont have to clean out some plastic protein bacteria hive oh greg so naive your glasses will still be just as disgusting yeah but theyre made of 1 thing rather than 3 mine is just a lid and a bottle with a filter in the top which is fine if you just fill it with water and shake it out and a ball no ball you don't need a ball if the lid has a filter what if i *like* the cunks chunks unless you have feable shaking ability then put some peanut butter in it you degenerate mmm so good im totally not gunna get one ill have to watch it every time which i will never do get one from smartshakers they're better than the shitty ones from myprotein or bulkpowders with balls in them they just have a lid with a filter and they aren't as big so it encourages you to mix it with less wate so you get it down quicker you sure i shouldnt get this its a doctor and is also the next level oh this is that one youve got top chefs have relied on the wisk ball for years nigga dont argue with that bottle its got a phd itll destroy you you fucking liftlet dr shake im gunna get some liquid egg whites i'm so curious what they actually are i mean isnt it in the name what does a white man's meal look like when he's afraid of food poisoning? mm so nice i love the unseasoned rice it really pulls together the whole meal it's okay because i have this urgh hahahaha what should i season my rice with? literally anything but nothing theres so many options its like if they gave you 100 options for a milkshake flavour and you chose water wait what oh i see give me suggestions rosemary and a bay leaf tarragon on the chicken on the rice? in the water i see nigga were you gunna straight up season the rice ye mmmmmmmmmm delicious crunch dry bay leaf and dry herbs my favourite wtf is bay leaf leaf from a bay tree its like it doesnt add an obvious flavour to food if you do it right its just there to subtly increase the depth of flavour sounds like exactly what i look for in seasoning its like putting salt on stuff you dont want it to end up tasting like salt it just hides in the shadows enhancing the food i see trust me nigga rosemary n a bay leaf grusome twosome ok where do i buy bay leaf can i get it pre ground? any shop you dont want it groud you throw it in the water it releases its oils when whatever it is youre cooking is cooked you take it out get it off the internet actually supermarkets are such ripoffs and literally anytime you make almost any sauce you can chuck one in kek asda amazon weird its literally 10% the price damn son wanna chill on disc? am bored af oof yeah i sure hope it works on linux :^) xd d m t just saw that dude again fuck where on a bench walking to the tube rip me new friend 🅱ollocks maybe hes more afraid of you than you are of him like a spider scrolling through discord after last night makes me feel dirty good you should be ashamed >you now you realise youre getting mogd 24/7 by the world around you nah mate m o g i mog everyone within a 10 mile radius of me i'm surprised the government hasn't issued a restraining order against everyone on me shouldnt that be the other way round one way or the other yes i'm walking fast forgive me senpai oh right all the bloods going to your feet thats a valid excuse or is it all pressed against your back because of how fucking fast youre yetting hahahaha it's all accumulating in my back yeah cause i'm basically at terminal velocity a dude i went to school/college with has just released an album and it's fucking awful like worse than i could've possibly imagines imagined* wow that was terrible i wish i could un listen to it i know right it was actually worse than i anticipated which i didn't think was possible because my expectations were already so low... at first i thought oh he's just trying to be the streets but then all elements of the song stayed the same for the entire thing god his voice is so fucking shaky and weird i know right was he a strange boy back then has it got some weird effects on it? i mean he was a bit odd, but not like totally odd and he doesn't sound like that really haha it's all connected by bill gates and that rain man, zuckerberg he and his jews have connected the whole world, and now they're toppling regimes and egypt and japan and the jews are all peaceful together bill plates you mean oh yeah shit what was the jaja binks one i forgot ?? bar bar? hahaha something like that found it meesa lift weight im not sure if the they whey is soothing my muscles or if its just the plasebee effect im ok with either though either is fine but it's almost certainly protein synthesis how many are you having each day? i havent decided yet i was just going to do one after every workout but the internet told me to have one in the morning but i dont know if i should have both i never have breakfast so i guess that could be my breakfast? but then i dont get the colossal benefits of if why the fuck do people bench like this pahahahaha that terrible form jesus christ you're meant to arch your back, so that your shoulderblades are retracted but people take it too far yeah, you should have breakfast have a shake and some sort of carbs a banana or some oats or something oats r 4 gosts especially on days when you train goats fuk that's every day apart from between legs and push when you have a rest day... i have a strong suspission that you're over training and under eating atm how much weight have you lost? i dunno i haven't weighed myself in a bit what's that you should be weighing yourself you don't wanna be losing too much weight you want to try and maintain your weight as a nooby lifter cause you want to build muscle so if anything you should be putting some weight on if you're losing a load of weight then you'll just be losing bodyfat and also muscle you can still get stronger without increasing muscle mass though ill weigh myself tomorrow gunna give a reckon i reckon i'm gunna weigh basically the same let's see if that reckon pays off lemme know i suspect you're lighter you looked leaner like grass fed bison yeah i was thinking when i saw you that you looked like you must've been eating grass mmm so good you're burning the fat hey i actually made a decent chilli not bad aesthetics s e a s o n t h a t r i c e man needs bay leaf you dont really want herby rice with chilli bit of paraprika n cumin lime juice oof solid rice god damn that chilli was fucking great i have surprised myself i thought it would be shit i added red wine and dark chocolate can really taste it depth flavour so deep you need to cook your onions for longer discord in a bit? yeah i added them too late and got impatient ???/ added? hungry boi theyre part of the base yeah i added them after the beef they should be there from the get go wat yr ye* i fooked it it's cause i started just thinking i was going to cook beef and then i was like oh shit i got the ingredients for a chilli so i pivoted like a nimble startup thats very agile of you did you get your chilli stories huh it was a joke about user stories o user stories kek what a silly name for writing down the things you need something to do maybe we can find a fun video game yes do that while i wash up kek ill do it again post shit tomorrow morning see how it compares what were you before? cant remember like just below 60 maybe? >start logging gregs heartrate creeper lol weird you've lost half a stone that's a lot is it yep i feel like ive put in basically no actual effort you're probably not eating enough i'd ramp up the protein a bit don't wanna lose anymore weight 60kg is outrageously light you'll be good at climbing you should give it a go lol what according to the nhs 70kg is a healthy weight for someone my height id be a fat fuck we should go whenever it is next weekend? as in not the coming one should go? huh climb oh yeah fo sho maybe i should have a shake i was going to not because i didnt do anything today hmm also are you done washing ill boot into windows and get me a _shake_ yes i'm on disc ive made a huge mistake oh no what i showed you that sub the meme stream will be dominated nah it'll die down like a pussboi give it a day i'm like a locust you devour the top all time posts i fuck the life out of something and then i move on and move on like mills with men ah el classique indeedio good italian babada boopi 🍤🦐 what can i cook shrimp with tom yum soup miso huh i don't know these words asian food look at this a whole pint of delicious cummies jesus christ that looks awful rise up gamers nice steel cup autist you got a metal straw for that too how the fuck do they get so much protein in whey maybe i should start the ol calorie tracking again it might have more purpose now the cups are provided by wework they've got motivational shit written on them terrible hahahahahahahah yeah, you should also ive decided this moment that im bored of my meme launcher shock it was a good run this was always inevitable first is aesthetics now its time for maximum u t i l i t y my workflow is going to be so fucking agile im so glad im on android and just downloaded the apks for all the bullshit apps needed to make that launcher linux wins again :^) isn't it great when you buy a product and then have to spend loads of time making that product work for you rather than just buying a product that solves problems for you instead of creating them 🍆💦🍎 but making things difficult for myself is the fun part also >buying apps i either use my googlebucks or download them i didn't say anything about buying apps buying a phone and then having to spend loads of time customising it so that its interface is good would it be weird making a chilli with ground turkey? oh i mean the stock launcher is fine has icons you press to launch apps i mean you could i guess or you could use it to make a more flavour friendly dish great design ive thought of a thing we can make do you like mushrooms nah but tbh i haven't tried them in a long time i hated them when i was younger but haven't tried them for years what is it? it's probably got an actual name something french baguettes? but it's basically chicken breasts in a white wine and mushroom sauce oh sorry yes baguettes for the penile extension oh yeah i love that shit sign me up guess the race gym eg kickboxing and sq squash if i worked at ibm would i hire her hahahahaha i bet she's an advanced excel user nice thanks mfp insightful wtf it expects so much protein is it even possible to hit that without actively trying nope i'm on 150g of protein a day and that's fairly low i told you, nobody consumes as much protein as they should for building muscle it's like the number one reason why people who go to the gym don't get bigger okay so i know what i'm having for dinner so i wonder how much more i'll need what have you eaten today? you need beans, nuts, meat, milk, whey a combination of them all can just about get me to my target daily oh, and protein bars help they're actually nice so with dinner i still need 36g more protein another shake and some nuts you had a weird lunch rice and eggs wtf oh the rice was supposed to be in dinner i just missed this is why everyone has loads of chicken and beef can get like 60-70 grams in easy that chilli i had last night was like 70 grams 💪🌶 that's huge enormous biblical like my arms 💪💪💪 somewhat 😂😂😂 don't send me that 😂😂😂😂😂😂 💯 i hope you lose all your gains 🔥 too far not ok barbar binks will green the lean machine scared of losing those gains scared indeed i wonder if they sell bulk protein bars at costco yeah probably hey phd ones they're doctors that taste great maybe ill absorb their brain as well as their brawn get* hahaha that was good oof they expensive yep they taste fucking great though these ones are so fucking nice maybe i should get some grenade carb killa jaffa quake hahaha no way are they called that no whey* nice why don't you get some maximuscle ones they maximise your muscles wow how is their branding that bad >chocolate peanut i didnt realise you were a peasant ? what's wrong with peanuts? you fucking pea separate they are fine my room smells like vanilla now it's great maybe if i saturate the air enough with protein powder i can just breath it in inhale all the protein you need maybe protein inhalers are a thing doesn't look like it sadly rip what about a protein vape? that's what i've got... don't judge no id know if you had a vape because i'd be mercilessly mocking you already can you imagine when i was fat i looked like i vaped but now i couldn't pull it off i bet you considered it never smoking is something i will never do fuck that i see behind those lying brown eyes william you just want to be cool apart from weed obviously yeah but that's natural so it's fine like jesus intended it's got chemicals in it still you monkey yeah but organic chemicals chemical chemicals chemical chemical gate gate they're grass fed chemicals so they're good for you nice lean chemicals mmm so good it's leg day idk if i can be bothered to go and squat with a smith machine it's probably not even worth it kek sure and you can squat with some air too although i sorta wanna squat with my weightlifting shoes for the first time ayyy you'll be so flat so stable so strong i bet i'll be able to squat like 150kg on a smith machine i'm actually interested to see how my smith squat differs to normal squat i bet the difference is insane i bet youll do 1.68x the weight did you google that isn't it great when you don't need stabilisers if only there was one plane in real life hahahahaha some girl came up on hinge who's got a video of her doing kipping pull ups how do people get memed into thinking theyre good for you wow look at that fucking swing shes doing a bad form pullup with bad form hahahaha my god what a tool why is she fucking braining herself on the bar its like 10x the joint stress of a regular pullup with .3x of the muscle usage it would be like i span round in a circle to do lat raises like a top you should get this to go with your new muscles why is it so fucking long he looks like some sort of banshee its literally just a dress but theyve used so many words to try and pretend its not christ it's awful as is "muscle fit" in general just get a well fitted t-shirt not some weird wetsuit like cling on its good at letting you know who is a collosal wanker true adam said he use to wear muscle fit would've loved to have seen that just watched was quite bad lame yeah his talking ones are usually a bit disappointing also his tattoos are fucking awful i thought they were fake the first time i saw a new video cus i hadn't watched in a while oh yeah it's awful both his arms look ridiculous he'll regret it what can i add to tuna and rice to make it interesting? chicken minus the tuna something lemony usually goes well with fish tinned tuna is difficult to season though it's like trying to season precooked chicken slices the best you can really do probably is season the rice well and add in some nice veg i weighed myself again its been like 7 hours since ive eaten 58.8 oof time to bulk how was mr smith jesus christ yeah, you need to eat more fuck me that's ridiculous that puts you underweight for sure actually not bad i leg pressed before though so i wasn't really able to max out got 140kg for 12 on the leg press though pr getting thicc i assume it's unironic big bowle boi you should ask her if she got an ace cheeky rice mmmm fuck beans are great i wonder how much protein beans have compared to nuts they are oh ok oof what a race wow generic nut? and generic bean? what do my favourite bean is (generic) bean this is so dry why did i think draining the liquid was a good idea is this what bodybuilders do just shovel dry mounds of good into their mouth food* good and food just pick one to replace rocket league? ye you on disc? not yet just getting some rice cakes boi mmm so

yep if you're short of calories you can eat some shit to get up to your target but don't eat loads of sugar because that'll just be converted to fat pretty much so like don't eat loads of milk chocolate or something eat nuts mans got no nuts mans eaten all his nuts damn son peanuts are such easy calories have some toast does this mean i need to go and eat like with peanut butter brown bread shit loads of it mmmm peanut butter eh ye im on board with that how much peanut butter is 1000 calories i bet its an uncomfortable amount yes you should have the shakes i make in the morning but then

ever seen at jam nights n short i hate it and it sucks agreed yeah that's the problem great technically bad at writing also i have a deep hatred for les pauls and bassists that play with picks

otherwise just get pots and soil and buy them from asda hmmm i might just buy them in pots from asda when you come for citizen maybe we could go and buy some erbs thrilling you need to pot them on though all the supermarket ones are really overgrown for their pot size hmmm maybe i should order seeds then get em off ebay if youre getitng seeds why? cheaper i c it depends what you want to make id reccomend basil as it makes an ez pasta chives are nice with eggs and light sauces basil, rosemary and mint is what i was thinking but idk what i'd put mint in tbh greek food cocktails i'm surprised you haven't gotten into lamb yet why? everyone on tinder/hinge keeps telling me i look greek wtf it goes spectacularly with mint and is v lean maybe you look like you belong in a failing economy

ears would be maybe they'd have abs what about the flappy bits fat ear lobes? yeh a quick google says no and also it's clear that many people get tunnels and they destory their ear lobes what a stupid craze that was gotta stretch out those lobes imagine if youd done that as a teenage id be regretting it every day it would probably be the biggest source of insecurity for me which is saying something just cut them off at that point get some fake lobes you have to put in every day like ear rings but then you're at risk of your lobes detaching at unfortunate times but without the rings your ear lobes may fall out when you're at your big interview with your ocular pat-down glasses at least they wouldn't be able to see your tears what it my ocular pat down glasses fill with tears and it's like

forward to telling him i feel like it's not going to go down well at all can you wear a gopro when you hand it in i don't understand how he doesn't see it coming so naice naive* hahahahaha who is the product manager is that grants boss nah he's basically my boss on my team we have crossfunctional teams for each product and one of those teams is one designer, one pm and a bunch of engineers designers report to grant and pms report to the head of product but i get my work from the pm on my team so the designer and pm on one of the 3 teams are leaving basically at the same time so one team will literally just be some engineers soon which will be a fucking disaster oh no that hilarious more like "dis" amirite i wonder if im going to see some more beamery ads pop up soon yes i suspect you will also ive finally removed the final rest from my floor leg raises literally just a single set of 120 now i can fold like paper the next step is figuring out how to make them heavier so i dont have to do 120 hahahaha 120?!?! no way can you do 120 leg raises in one set i do not believe that for a minute just did it broski you're definitely doing them wrong do some this weekend and i'll correct your form i bet you flail around like a fish im doing this minus the bench are your glutes coming up off the ground at the top? are your legs perfectly straight are you controlling the movement on the way down? your legs should come down super slow yes mostly no and they shouldn't touch the ground when you bring them down im whizzing them down that's the problem and catching them before they hit the ground so its faster it's all about the ecentric i tried googling that google thinks its not a real word i spelt it wrong eccentric wait no oh see thats what i thought it might be but it still didnt make sense to me yeah, that's right that's how you spell it to be keen and kooky? huh look at the link i sent oof so the down is just as important as the up i noticed that with curls get them burny forearms on the way down the down is more important than the up in almost every movement you do don't let the weight fall control its decent i do like my control to be good and proper yeah i do with weights i just dont with bodyweight oops it's especially important for leg raises i could do leg raises forever if i let my legs fall down you'll spend less time exercising too id like to see that because intensity will go up so you won't have to do 120 reps hmm whats the increase in intensity to reduction in reps ratio depends what you want to do higher rep ranges at a lower intensity are good for building muscle a e s t h e t i c s but lower rep ranges and higher intensity are good for building strength so a e s t h e t i c s = low weight, high reps but 120 leg raises is ridiculous you're just not doing them right stop shaming me just do more hanging leg raises they're more intense but you should also not be letting your legs fall down on a leg raise ye or knee raise im just doing knee raises we can go to the gym in my building on friday maybe i havent got the height for leg and i'll show you properly how to do knee raises i cant hold myself up high enough for that long yeah i just dangle n knee that's annoying i extend slightly as i go up its a weird hybrid ye show me your movements william yeah that's not great and i will copy ideally you need your legs to be straight do you not have somewhere outside? where you can do that what like an outdoor doorframe? thats higher than an average doorframe? yeah for outdoor people giants and such hmmm ill have a look around no, like a tree or maybe a shed that you could mount it to but im not convinced maybe ill go to the local childs playground or you could get some rope around branches of a tree and do it with olympic rings or a trx but you're white i think im just going to carry on doing knee raises and do more of them only on the very outside god my shits are so dense these days but you need to be able to do them properly same as leg raises or you're waiting your time wat i can do knee raises fine just not leg raises no, you need to hang with your legs straight hang straight then lift your legs up and touch your knees to your chest full range of motion oops ive been doing them like this that's okay? but it's a lot easier that man's head is so small i know its all i ever see is he generic exercise man i feel like i've seen him before yeah hes the man they use for whatever website it is makes all those diagrams should i do them like this with a man pushing his hand into my anus and fondling my man meat that's so weird wtf that's literally a meme you could post that on reddit with no context and it would be upvoted maybe i will you got it yet nah just emailed them chasing anyone else quit

best practices? oooh ill try that nice words they should call you will green ink because of the words what? >imo, best practice is to take "best practice" advice and people who regularly use that phrase with a healthy level of suspicion. thanks so nice im suspicious of you will but only to a healthy level have you quit yet 🤠 uhhhh yee haw cowboy i'm the sherif of niger okay buddy ʳᵉᵗᵃʳᵈ where did you get that picture of me lol bant hehe kek stop saying hehe its like youre trying to fuck me hehe xd lolrandom rawr roflcopter goes soi soi soi soi? i forgot to tell you this morning i didn't put enough milk in my oats and it was fucking terrible you should've seen it it was horrific and i couldn't be fucked to go back to the kitchen to add more milk and heat it up again so i just sat at my desk and picked at it like some sort of famished bird isnt your desk like not my home desk 5 seconds away my work desk oh but yeah probably 10 seconds thats grim it was honestly terrible chunky oats mmm i felt so sad after like when you have sex with a girl you're not in to it isnt even worth it you just regret not getting up to get the milk just so much regret all round jack is telling me to try overnight oats apparently they're better to me it sounds terrible why are they all in fucking jars because theyre traditionally made by wankers just use a plastic box like a normal person mmmmm what about a bowl like a normal person need a lid m'nigga ahh to keep the moisture in that's fucking shit bun that i'll just microwave them bois in the evening mmmmmmm pre microwaved oats instant oats they're great if only there was just some tasteless paste you could shove into your mouth that you didnt have to heat up and had everything you needed what's wrong with instant oats? they aren't pre microwaved they're just oats that you put in milk and microwave i know i was disgusted by you suggesting microwaving them in the evening as prep for the next day oh no fuck that that wasn't what i was suggesting oh right thats slightly less grim then can i just buy a sack of oats rather than sachets? i bet it works out waaaaay cheaper yes i shall do that i dont actually know what the difference is between "instant" oats and a sack of oats i think instant just comes in handy packets yeah i think so too which annoys me they're marketed like they're a different thing what's a brand of normal oats? i have no idea just get a sack mmmmm lovely oat sack look at this delicious chicken too there you go there's some hinge girl that's like me and her pics aren't loading you should guess her ethnicity icelandic? i guess we will see whenever it loads sometimes they never load thats so sad how will i know rl? yeah gimme 10 can you take a 5 id really like you to take a 5 right nown also her profile

wills 7"1 who is this 10 foot monster hahahaha fuck i saw some fit height chart that went up to like 7'4 and everything was the normal below 6 foot kill yourself 6'4 master height then it just jumps to 7'4 and just says "blessed hungry skeleton" next to it now whenever i think about jack all i think is hungry skeleton hahahaha it's true although i wouldn't consider it a blessing i bet it's

sub 10% bodyfat basically it's a load of shit, but it has yohimbine in it which is a legit thing that burns body fat but research on it being used topically is limited so there is some truth to it why

so she wants to match with other cunts you should tell her you aren't a nazi but do enjoy a trip to the chinky god damnit i said no to her already im such a fool bafoon you hated get profile so much that you didn't even mock her her * what have i become soon be big like frog big ribiit apparently it's from a thread where some kid was worried he'd put on too much weight during his bulk and for some reason the lighting was really green so someone did this love it frog fibers all u need fibers from frig no tren required what you doing this weekend? killing myself probably ive almost run out of whey im worried what will happen to my gainz should i get a sack or some plant protein depends does whey sit alright with your stomach? if it does get a sack if not, get plant protein fam ye my stomach stong like frog nice just get whey then it's cheaper higher protein content better amino acid profile if it doesn't fuck up your stomach then you're fine to just use whey 80 quid for a 4.54kg sack fuck on? ye i don't think it was that expensive when i got it maybe just try myprotein think they're the cheapest bulk powders is even cheaper eh it's just as expensive £100 for 5kg you want isolate not on amazon oh shit uhhh get bulk powders then i see check the content though will it be obvious if its isolate just check the content it should be like 25g of protein for 130 cals or something just compare the on one against it myprotein 20g 100 calories thats basically the same seems about right is that diet whey or isolate? it'll say in the title bulk 24g protein ah 122 cal about the same if you go for myprotein, just make sure you don't get 'diet whey\ cause they put a bunch of other shit in it oh i dont think the myprotein one is isolate like green tea extract and cla it doesnt say it anywhere obvious you don't want that shit link oh i just scrolled down and found the isolate one whys that so much cheaper which one? bp? ye idk i think that myprotein one is a really old listing or something it has their old branding and most of it is out of stock seems weird just go for bp its still 27 quid on their website though ye love the name 5kg will last you fucking ages you gunna bulk son bulk full of powders i dont want to be powdery though kek you want to be greg hardbody leonard 2.5kg 5kg haha wtf just buy two 2.5kg then it's probably something to do with amazon's automated pricing based on demand have a look on camelcamelcamel see if has fluctuated i knew it was some kind of four legged fur animal its all over the place what about the 5kg one damn son wtf it's like entirely protein shit this is only the 90 my poor gains more expensive though £120 for 5kg vs £100 for 90 why's it so cheap on amazon? it's way more expensive on their own website i mean whey more expensive ayyy i have no idea maybe theyve gotta compete more with other ones on amazon? not a clue am i being an idiot there's more protein per calorie in bp by quite a significant margin wtf yup looks like it fuck. i've been jipped even per calorie bp is better i don't think it tastes as good from what i can remember who cares getting huge isnt about enjoying food its about shoveling in the necessary biomass to get h u g e it's about eating chicken and rice plane chicken and rice right, well i need to finish my 5kg sack of on whey so i can switch to the good stuff... that's well annoying i bet i won't finish it for ages >plane chicken i thought you had bulk powder stuff hahahaha ive seen that logo somewhere wtf is that why did you have that on hand? i get my creatine from them and greens and collagen whey is from on i think on add bcaas but turns out they're bullshit anyway i have an entire directory of <transport>/unikonta/obazoa/opisthokont/holozoa/filozoa/animalia/chordata/aves/galliformes/phasianidae/gallus/g.gallus/g. g. domesticus that was so worth copying off wikipedia nice what is a bcaa is that like a banana it's what you find in bananas what actually are they do they do anything or is it just for people on the edge spending 20 hours in the gym a day branch chain amino acids nah all protein contains bcaas bcaa is just another layer of extraction on whey so it's basically pure and has like 10 calories so people thought it was really good for cutting cause you could get all the protein you needed without consuming any calories but it turns out they're bullshit because you still need other amino acids on top of bcaas to build muscle im shocked a fitness fact was proven to be shit so basically, if you really want to cut you can just take eaas (essential amino acids) i have no idea what anything is anymore eaas are almost the same, but they have other amino acids and slightly more calories i thought cutting just meant eating less yes and no when you're on a cut you want to maintain your muscle mass while losing body fat so eating less, but not too little and you still need to eat the same amount of protein so you basically have to drop your carbs and fats, keep your protein the same that's why people liked the idea of bcaas because it meant that they could eat more carbs and fats cant you just eat less carbs and fat while still maintaining a caloric deficit if that makes sense and keep your normal protein yes absolutely that's 100% what you should do but people wanna eat more while cutting if that means paying £40 for some powder i guess compared to the roids its nothing yeah people take eaas intra-workout because they digest really quickly and they're good to take when fasting cause they don't spike your insulin so you can maintain muscle while burning fat that's the idea but ultimately the best thing to do is just make sure you're eating the right macros whey is still the king 🤴king whey why is there no powder emoji we need a whey emoji let's tweet tim apple 🐮❌♨🧂 i cant believe you got cucked by on youre going to be so embarssed once i overtake you from my extra protein ikr in two months you'll be bigger than me your damn linear gains marginally steeper than mine will overtake me in a matter of weeks imagine it i could do linear gains and if my x is days 27g per bar by month 3 i can go from benching a 1kg dumbell to a 90kg dumbell i think you mean huge 27g per bar oh yeah sorry huge 27g as opposed to a regular 27g that bp says 'unrivalled 23g bcaa per 100g' i don't understand what that means ohhhh per 100g for every 23g of bcaa it packs in 100g of bcaas fuck i wish i'd got this to hit 30g i need to have like 1.25 scoops of on which is like 200 calories ffs do you wanna buy my sack for sheap cheap* kek how much hmmmmmmmmmmmm what'ya reckon i think i've had about 10 scoops out of it how much was it £80 by the looks on my amazon history go on you lil jew buy it and carry it all the way home like the lil jew you are it's really tragic this morning i typed in everything i'd eat today on myfitnesspal and so far i've stuck to it without even thinking about it i'm so predictable hmmm ill give you 55 hmmmmmmmmm nah i'll keep it and yeet my whey through it carrying it back would be a fucking bitch it's huge i was sure you were going to bargain for more money maybe your nose is missized i would have if i was seriously considering it but i think you'd see it in person and be like fuck that i aint carrying that shit ive seen it it would make my back strong like a frog you really want to be like a frog don't you you should start necking some of those frog fibers damn look at that ripped frog boy #inspiration #goals i can't find any good photos of your face i was going to shop that photo properly there arent any didnt you take some on the tube too real fam oh y e s i didn't have photoshop so

ya when he taought you python someone at my old work wants to start learning but most of the "free online python" courses are shit i don't know python he just showed me how a flask api works because

abysmal i wonder if any of them managed to listen to the entire track jesus did he make that on purpose i hate the name too and the artwork it's so trash >clean your team up 😂 💯💯 i thought it was a hardcore band i think he wants that vibe but with shitty electronic music the crossover everyone was waiting for do foam rollers actually do anything or are they a meme mixed bag research wise a lot of people swear by them apparently they're actually better for building muscle than improving recovery hmm sounds suspicious google it it defo works for some people it makes my legs feel better after doms for sure sad scoop internet died :( it's not coming back rip just matched with some girl on tinder and she had some shit about being a twitch thot in her boi bio8 * so obviously i immediately

some sweaty teenage fat guy with some girls face shopped on it it's so weird reported him, what a degenerate show me fam one sec aahh mate can't retrieve it as i blocked basically it was just a picture of a dude holding up a piece of paper with will written on it in horrific man handwriting and a poorly overlayed image of some girl on his face and the hair like faded in to the background it was really fucking weird i can't believe you didn't screenshot that youve disappointed me why would he shop a girls face over his own face that's weird maybe it was a joey salads kill your friends with a gun prank my immediate reaction was report this sex pest before he assaults someone soz ikr i said "mate, that's such a bad shop it's tragic. why would you overlay it you weird moron" ahh fuck yeah that's defo what it is i wish i could retract my report you're the weird moron here you've fallen for the classic blunder tbf it was an outstanding move look this shit i got in the post "i do deals for a living taking no deal off the table is bonkers" wow i'm convinced now hahahaha that's the one i picked up on the bottom right is funny too it just doesn't make any sense in the context of

you've gotta eat food like a fucking caveman now casey green sad vibes no more convenience of yeeting it down like a cup of tea why does he talk about fishing and shit what is this i have no idea he

like vanilla maybe slightly less keen to mix itself? but that's not really an issue since the muscle it provides will contribute to more severe mix ability it's a vicious circle hmu when you back every single fucking time i boot into windows fuck you bill lmao we're just coming gay choo choo i have a little project for you that i think you'll enjoy fugg what you got for me basically i want to automatically populate a field in an excel spreadsheat with my weight every day and also auto-populate a different field with my calorie intake everyday both come from myfitnesspal, which has an api send me ya spreadsheet just given you view access for now but can give you edit rights if you need them click enable the google sheets api and send me the client config the json file i hope this doesn't give you access to all of my sheets it doesnt sadly i have to specify the sheet id i cant just browse to clarify - at the end of each day when i mark my diary as complete in mfp, i want to import my weight and my calories for that day in to the associated cells for that day i don't want it to do it retrospectively or anything yes massa of course massa juke and jive for ya massa if this works, i think it would be a good app idea because no other tracking app does this at the moment and it's way more important than just tracking calories and weight seperately i love apps maybe it can be a wapp wapp? webapp like oh those websites er that download an app pwa piggas with attitude yep that's the one dude bruh you made this sheet with science? _nice_ i didn't make it you nonce no shit you fucking abortion escapee you weird moronic abortion escapee i've cracked it will i just found a reddit post that puts all the pieces into place there's a new shapchat filter that overlays a girl face on yours wow so that's why there's loads of these weird profiles appearing? it's so strange yup have you seen them too? i haven't got any yet i just had to apply for api access for mfp so this may be a no go however nah you can access a full report of food using a url web scrappin ez this message was deleted wow that's what i had on my clipboard but i'm guessing you need to be authenticated to read that? i do that's doable though you can use credentials in gets boom bam i think i can make it public one sec oh yeah that'll be easier nope login screen hmm ye that works dope i have no idea how to tell when you finalise it though you can either run it manually or it can do it by itself at midnight the only thing you can't see on that is my weight do your scales have a website? maybe they add to my fitness pal where i can't find it on any public pages soz was on the tube * hmmm what make is your scale? there will be a way withings it's defo on mfp somewhere i can see it in reports but it's a private page kek your scale has an open api what a time we live in fuck they have to approve it thats bullshit same as mfp yeah it's annoying i applied for the mfp one hmmmm might be a public page got withings they have a web app where does it show it on a private page on mfp in the page called reports and also when you go to log a new wright can you copy the url weight^ it tells you previous weigh in you won't be able to see it without being logged in as me i know and i'm just going gym just gimmi the url you fruit not at my laptop or pc 👺 oof i have potential hmu when ur at ur pc kk what'ya do you can just use a post request with username/pw so you can access all ur shit o o f noice how'd you get calories in from a day that doesn't exist? what you talkin about day that doesnt exist oh yesterday soz didn't see what what are you talking about 14 may i see now that it is a day that exists it was yesterday ???? because today is the 15th its today today exists are you ok it ain't the 14th fam its the week beginning the massive retard have you even looked at your own spreadsheet you massive retard* oh i see i haven't actually used the sheet yet because the manual entry is bullshit you fucking weird moron mc? mein campf im connecting urls ok noice that should work fine i mean cause it would be the only way to cure my insufferable insecurities seriously watch that the dude is clearly fucked up needs to stop and go for counselling before he kills himself god what the fuck is he talking about wait until he starts going through everything he takes it's mental fucking like 4 different injections 3 times a week and about 5 oral steroids on top and then a shit load of supplemenents you should do that i bet youll get huge and angry just a quick cheeky cycle no harm h u n g fuck is that all i need to do also are you certain you dont want to be able to fill in any retrospective weight/calories i mean obviously you have to smash a load of steroids hmmmm idk i just suspect it'll be inaccurate or the weight won't match up properly i mean the weight and calories have to match perfectly itll be based on what youve put in for every day or it'll fuck the algorithm so however much faith you have in yourself yeah it should be fine _should_ could do it on another sheet havin a big _should_ just in case up to you homie ill make whatever you desire right can you try a thing and go on edit and set the date to the start of the year does it show all your weigh ins page not found find it then you dope its this i'm looking their ui is so unintuitive if i go to edit previous entries i can see my history but it's paginated if you're trying to scrape it thats fine fuck how many entries does it show before it goes to a new page i need to put in a shit load of them now to test it thanks mike and albert lee 10 per page there's 17 pages oh thats fine por favor can you go on that page again and send me a screenshot of your paginator sure one sec or do you need the whole view? no thats good if ur gunna scrape o shit you star svgs are so long it's horrific lmao it's actually a table jesus i know right i knew youd love that big table lover will all of their classes have such descriptive names too "first" "col-num" yeah i looked at it and was like 'lol have fun with that greg' * closed tab * fuck you go flex in the bathroom :( "look at my tiny wings" "i can barely fly with these" jesus that was awful what retard made mfp they didnt consider my needs for sure kek done? right make a copy of that sheet for testing purposes and share it with: gspreadtest@willmfp.iam.gserviceaccount.com doing it now done righto do you know how to use pop? pip i assume you have python installed already nah not on either of my machines atm actually maybe my work laptop would have to check right well you need to do that why? i don't understand what it's written in python? but why would i need to run something? i want it to run every day remotely forever

go walk in front of the clipper what's her hotness to wall of text ratio i'd give her like a 6, borderline 7/10 at mos most* now you just need to factor in your thirst variable and you get a number that tells you if you should bother with her if it's an easy lay, then i'll go for it but i don't think it will be cause she's being really intense clearly wants a relationship so there's two thirst variables that need to be factored in here uhhh go to hers and ghost her ez epic win 😎 sharpio that pooper god damn, i am literally just one big dom today. squats from two days ago have left my legs

will combined in to one megadom are you trying to relationship me nah, your ratio is all off i'm afraid damn that curse-ed ratio you have a low wall of text rating, but an even lower hotness rating sorry o k s oof o r r y nice gotta bump up that relative hotness have you considered talking steroids i hear they're great for recovery every day especially oral steroids copious amounts of oral steroids and throw some sarms in there for good measure they're not real cus they're oral and no one even knows what sarm stands for so they must be safe aren't they just the stuff you get from bananas? i think so just another form of bcaa yeah that's why it's an acronym same length too 100% safe confirmed nice post this chat log on examine definitely a reliable source nobody could even question this whatsapp conversation weve presented an irrefutable chain of login logic we should show mr athlean i hear he's a lean, extreme athlete like us ive actually heard he's a athlete lean

chuffed mans on 6 eggs a day t h i c c big protein 6??? jesus 3 for breakfast 3 for lunch literally the only good thing about working there careful when you get home you won't be able to walk through the door i already have to go through sideways maybe you'll have to go through lengthways i'll have to go through he back patio door it's enough for 3 regular men or 1 me nice post workout meal shove that keenwah down your gullet i've got pull today but no motivation maybe i need to watch some broscience those gunshots will hype me up you should just play the gunshot noise on repeat while you're working out how many pull ups can you do now? heck yea brotha last time was 9, 5, 5 lets see what i can bash out now oof just hit the big 1-0 wide grip? nice that but also with the other arm involved yeah that's as wide as you can go on the door ones you need to watch this dude he's fucking hilarious ill check him out in a bit i swear to fuck my shoulders are always the first thing to start being sore how do i get bigger shoulders should i inject test just into my shoulders it's not a size thing and it's not a delt thing if it's on pull day that they hurt it'll be your rotator cuffs you probably need to start doing a few rotator cuff warm up sets before pull ups either use a band or you can use two light plats let me find a pic god there are so many fucking muscles inside me this is the easiest one that's what i do every day at the gym but he actually does do it before every workout so he doesn't fuck his shoulders that hilarious do it with a really light weight though or you'll kill your shoulders how much like 2.5? i do them with 1.75 plates one in each hand dang aint got any of them i wonder how much my bars weigh ye you do the bars will be about that probably oh yeah the baby ones one of your plates will be around 1 1.25 i forgot about them because i dont use them since im so massive now that'll do e? doin pull init oh i thought you were on reddit >he doesnt spend his rest on reddit pleb whats the true way to do curls broscience said i should be doing them with my elbows glued to my side ye or do preacher curls google em dont i need a thing to do them on from the looks of it nah one arm at a time sit and use your knee oh right i get ya concentration curls is what mr bro called them nicr what does that even mean you do them once youve built satisfactory mass hahaha as in like overall width and size preachers are for the peak but i think they're still good anyway for the peak what does that mean better to do concentration curls than bad form standing curls where you cheat also when am i even going to build satisfactory mass muh dismoyphia it means when you flex, the top round bit of the nice bicep* concentration curls are hard as fuck ya which is good ive really gotta concentrate that's why arm blasters are great i thought targeted exercises were bad muh compound back down to 7.5 ashamed my famiruu muss commit sodoku compounds are better yeah for overall muscle gain but isolation is better for developing specific muscles and just doing a nice curl with bad form doesn't make it compound it just makes it a badly performed isolation exercise damnit well i guess like that big black man said everybody wanna be a bodybuilder but nobody wanna lift no heavy ass weight yep btw if you have a place to host the script itll work you should ask harry to put it on his vm with the mc server can i just use heroku or digital ocean i have no idea hang on god their websites have so much bullshit on are they just clouds that you can run shit on yeah with wrappers and stuff sure dont see why not like cli tools and shit for deployments ill deployment on ur mum thanks mate anytime im so confused about what these are pubg? how is it different from just a vm heroku has a bunch of tools that makes it easier one click installs of different stacks a gui to hook up to repos, manage configs etc does it have an entrepreneur stack could do a game or two gunna make dinner in like half an hour probably more like 5 or 6 games lol in a bit we eating soon too your protein cycles have synced adam has eaten i have not we are out of sync we gunna play now though damn im just about to cook god what a disaster this all is lol buy i'm on 5 thats such a horrific looking meal it's banging i dont like your feet in that it makes it feel scummier than it already is i made a delicious pasta sauce and murdered it with cheese nice lovey lovey fat i had mixed beans, mozzarella, eggs, potato waffles and turkey banging protein actually not bad macros its basically whey protein and fat copious amounts of fat lil smidgen of protein thats the joy of never meeting your calorie goals kek what does fat turn into does it turn into gains depends on the fag lol fat* oops bit of a slip there straight man will saturated fat turns in to body fat a freudian 🍆🍆 like 1:1 nah higher than carbs though depends how much of a deficit you're in too or surplus last i checked apparently like 600 calories but i havent weighed myself in a bit lol maybe ive become fat i think it also raises your cholestarol so it damages circulation in high quantities basically but i think it's basically fine as long as you're not eating chips every day of your life but whey lowers protein no cholesterol whey lowers chloesterol as does excersise god its all fucking swings and roundabouts it is just try do more good stuff and less bad stuff so you are net good or net better than bad i think im achieving that 💯💯 pub? ye 1 min this message was deleted mans a tired man goin to bed leik kk so soz was hanging up clothes that i forgot were in the dryer how could you :( oh god oh no he's got a wooden pickaxe he can't hear us you should play some idle games at work they're excellent wastes of time steve's for airpods in got* i swear swipe keyboard have gotten worse link me up or name them go on r/incrimental_games if they literally don't care what you're doing there's some more involved ones try crank if that's the case that's good fun or if you do need to be a little bit subtle there's loads where you just do some resource and production management every now and then or i dunno how familiar you are with java script but bit burner is fun too but you write all your production in netscript the classic every now and then game is kittens though you can just tab out for like 10 minutes get some resources tab back in and buy some stuff repeat interesting i am currently enjoying browsing reddit though and that seems to be a pretty good time sink i'm currently cooking some oats at work as you do i also have meetings for like the next hour of course but the great thing about idle games is that you can be idle? is that you can play them while youre not thete exactly you got it have you asked coffee man yet nah i'll do that after meetings that should take me nicely to lunch time then i'll go out for an hour come back at like 1:30 ready to do some "work" nice i know from personal experience a lunch pint fills one with motivation i was thinking a glass of red or maybe some vodka speaking of vodka watch that dude i sent you he just travels around russia and beelarus meeting strangers it's a lot more entertaining that in sounds red eh fancy oh yeah remind me later watch that dude who travels around russia and belarus later thanks bixby hey bixby, end my suffering sorry i can't do that yet $name 😈 so i've been talking to some girl on bumble she seems pretty normal right but i just found her insta and it looks like she's borderline famous like influencer tier and i actually don't think she's a catfish it's pretty weird oof she's got 30k followers on insta and for some reason danny brown follows her... do you have a picture of your lats on bumble she's not even that fit maybe she likes small lats so like i don't feel like anyone would pretend to be her like she's good looking but not like fit enough for some catfish to be like 'yeah i'll pretend to be her' that'll be it i found out what she's famous for fucking pageants oh fuck big mood alert like frank's little beauties? apparently i have a very high risk of depression for someone my age who'd've thunk it i guess so maybe i should sing a song about how i don't diddle kids pretty rad i saw that there was some problem with it but i can't remeber what bitburner is weird

i'm going to guess yes ehhh once you got a nice amount of angels okay, so not now you dont want to blow 10000 angels on 3x cus they give you more ye, you need a good base to multiply on i have two million angels now i guess i should probably start sacrificing them as in you'll gain or in total 4mil total now 40mil it's just exponential isn't it why am i hooked on this fuck this is just the start adv cap is like your first rock of crack oh no what next? the bigger your number the more your number gets bigger soon you start playing the ones that take literal months to get anywhere in

well even if it isn't going to be they're both oop so it's pretty much all transferable and it's easier to learn python syntax so if i know it in java i can just write some pseudocode and it'll be python yeah true it also looks good on your cv because everyone hates java exactly if someone only knows python id just assume theyre some giant brainlet maybe i should put lua on my cv too wb scratch

confusion i think that must be it you've hit the nail on the head the proverbial head and the literal * confused noises * i know id be confused going out with someone and being forced to watch frozen daily in a house full of disney plushes and wooden signs that say 'love' or 'home' this isn't a house it's a home oh shit oh fuck guess what i just ordered lovely rhys wanted me to relay to you that your name is short for great egg great egg gory great in size or quality? i mean obviously not size for an egg i would consider myself great in size this is true you're quite a chodey egg w i d e what surely i'm a long egg i'm not very wide nah you're proportional like relatively speaking what relative to an egg? are you saying i have the same proportions as an egf no im saying the proportions don't matter they're relative to a human egg not an egg human human eggs arent in the shape of tiny people yeah they are it depends which way around the words are like the whole man spider/spider man thing what youre talking about is egg humans im talking about human eggs hmmm yeah i think that makes sense an egg human is a regular human that has become an egg probably a human egg is an egg that has become a human of course and so therefor i am wait no so how am i chodey i still dont get that youre making no sense old man well, the direction of the transition determines the scale im going to have to put you in a home i.e. an egg human would be an egg with human sized proportions a human egg would be human with egg size proportions so one of the ways you would be long for an egg and the other way you'd be short for an egg no the other way i would be short for a human relative to your original state i would be a perfect egg size but a bad human size why? so you're saying you're bad human size already? because i am an egg and so i become a human so im an egg shaped human no, you are a human and you became an egg so you're a long egg exactly thats what im saying you said id be chody great we're on the same page now no we arent i thought one of the ways you would be chody id like to continue but turns out you wouldn't be okay now we are on equal paging ye 🐄 perhaps lol you

economically i think that's sensible you gotta listen to your body like a whisper in the wind a man let's me out of the office every day it's super weird i thought it was just because it was my first day or he happened to be by the door but no, every day he gets up and opens the door for me it makes me so uncomfortable even today when i came back from lunch he opened it for me thats really weird is he just like a regular employee give me deets a/s/l he's the receptionist downstairs how did he have time to get to the door when you were coming back does he do it for everyone i think so i saw him do it for my boss maybe his job is actually a doorman i didn't know that was a thing anymore thats so weird dont they know you can get doors that open by themselves and dont include awkward thanks "thanks for opening the single door in my life ive only got 200 more to open manually today" god i am wish he followed me and opened every door for me a portable doorman unlike those scummy non-portable doormen you can save your arms for when you need to do chest rather than some weird lopsided vertical push exercise perfectly uniform bench finally thank you door man i wish doors had their hinges at the top so i could use both arms symmetrically to open doors genius the end of muscle imbalance mc? i seent it mirin' i wish i couldnt get my tshirt on have you actually seen that? wtf why? dunno it appeared on fit of course who is that synthol man i want to see his arms in a normal context like just sat having a coffee or something some russian man what a fucking tool he put too much synthol in and they exploded and got all infected so hes got regular skinny arms again oh shit i wanna see i didnt see his healed skinny arms on his gross half infected sewn up skinny arms only oh boy i just saw both jesus that wasn't pretty how surprising what did he think would happen? big arms = big strong he's so fucking skinny it just looks ridiculous you're just jealous of them gains can you even inject like a reasonable amount of synthol without it fucking you up? the man's smuggling bowling balls he is huge ones at that i didnt even notice his stupid pink hair maybe if you just do isolation on your 'ceps you too can become that hench why is he wearing a grey long-sleeve with the union jack on it? all i've ever wanted is disproportionately big arms... his range of motion must be in the single digits i wonder how many girls he gets for doing all those curls 1 girl per curl damn son that's millions of girls i better start curling there's some dude at work called michal sosnowski every time i see it in slack i just think of mike getting nutted you should dress as sully one day i absolutely should do that i just went to the garden centre and three people started

don't think i've ever seen a 2kg dumbell wouldn't that just be the handles of two dumbells? with no weight or cuffs maybe you should try looking more not harder just more you can get those ones that women use to pretend to do exercise look theyre pink to match the femininity of the weight oh wow they really are pink... jesus think about the amount of volume i could get out of them... damn son

video of him drunk shouting at me for leaving hahahaha fuck that's so weird i know right hahahaha so fucking awkward you should reply with a pdf of a management styles handbook also what aux lifts can i do on my off days apart from rotator cuffs aux? i can't remember what they're actually called just like little lifts that will help with the big lifts complimentary? accessory? that's the word rotator cuffs, rear delt (face pulls or reverse flys), hip flexer stuff like pigeon poses or walking leg rotations, also just windmilling is actually pretty good for your shoulder health main things to focus on for that stuff are your shoulders and your hips basically they're the two joints that always get fucked so you saying i should just stand and windmill aight get them pit clobberers in shape cant wait think about all those hips you'll be opening gotta get those leg rotators in too haha that's not them i've forgotten what they're called it's when you raise your thigh up then rotate the leg 90 degrees outwards virgin supination vs chad pronation this pigeon pose shit is impossible i dont know if im just unflexable or if im shoving my body into a shape thats actually damaging really! i think my weird hip flexibility makes it easy for me ease in to it don't push through any pain just do it until you feel a stretch you have weird full body flexiblity nah it's just my legs really and my hips my arms are fairly normal thanks for cropping me out fam has that made it to your hinge? not everything is about you will but its slightly off centre actually it's so warped perfect for a circle adam seems to be the continuity in our dps maybe theres something about him the light bends in a flattering way around his huge muscles to make everyone else shine too after having chicken and rice two scotch eggs and a huel that huge vein on his foot shows through his sock why does he have such a large spoon for such small yoghurts he had to go back and get a smaller spoon and yes that vein is very weird i'm going to buy an ableton push i have decided also which bars did you get? my usual quest go to is out of stock good decision optimum nutrition whipped bites choc i wanna make some rad synthwave make some a e s t h e t i c tunes home 2.0 they look grim what do they taste like? better get started on your music theory nigga they look like swiss rolls what are you talking about yeppp anything you'd recommend? apparently there's some book that's like the book i've forgotten what it's called though i happen to know a professional keys teacher i usually ask him you should try and find one of them i played piano when i was younger i feel pretty comfortable what not playing you dope theory and retard can hit keys any* he's like my pete of music gotta fully utilise the bigbrains the brain provides sorry, someone came over i was going to go on to say i need to learn theory this is good reference material http://tobyrush.com/theorypages/pdf/complete.pdf bigbrain pete is that more about music theory generally for both performing and composing? or just composing? its the same thing there isnt any composition focused music theory that's not quite true i know what you mean if you cant play it and understand it you cant write it but when i think of performance i think of reading music i mean you can but itll just be a stab in the dark and learning scales well thats wrong composing takes different skills than reading and play music but in terms of theory its the same i know it does that's why i'm asking does it cover both but in terms of theory its the same or is it just stuff relevant for composing if you want to do theory based composition you cant just go straight into writing you need to play first no, you're missing whst i said does it teach stuff to do with performance that way as in, read and play music hmmm i'm not sure that's true is it? i know plenty of people who write music who aren't particularly great at playing keys i mean obviously you can write music with literally no understand of how music works but youll just be putting together sounds that you think sound nice without understand why if thats all you want to do there isnt much point learning theory hmmmm is it easier to put sounds together that sound nice if you understand theory absolutly okay i guess that's the crux of it it increases your ability to make things that sound nice using theory rather than playing around okay yeah i'll learn theory the way its been explained to me is that you dont activly think about theory when you play and write its something that runs in the background that works like intuition which makes sense yeah that makes sense so where should i start with music theory? one of those links you sent? read that picture with what chris said go over the abrsm stuff yeah i had a look there will be and you should probably watch some of them too but as he said theory is dry and boring its just actual work to learn it yeah there's a dude who does theory about popular songs which is quite engaging maybe i should get an actual keyboard before getting a push ive got a babies first keyboard and stand you can have how big is it though? want something that can go on my desk my new room is smol yeah so in that video you can fully appreciate how much theory knowledge goes into writing more interesting music all of the little things he must have done in the writing process that would just be guesswork oh right itll be too big then its a 61 key protip you should branch into jazz i need a better sound card too theres a reason every single successful session musician is a hardcore jazzer the one i got is shit i'll get a scarlet red thing yeah how do i get in to jazz first you spend years learning theory and have an active interest in jazz and then you just keep playing jazz i think i only need 3 or 4 octaves probably 4 depends if you want to play music youll need at least 5 even that is a bit restrictive hmmmm so if you get a 49 key itll go down to c2 and as luck would have it here are our boys vulf throwing a c2b in and then youd be fucked that dude change his picture on our issue tracking software can't deal nah i'd just use that fucking shift bend what a fucking picture oh shit just a single key and get your prebend down to a t heck ye i feel like a 49 key is enough for me what will you want to be doing playing some simple stuff and writing music (playing chords and melodies with one or two hands across a few octaves) i don't want to start playing funk and jazz keys like a madman you do but that will most likely suit your needs then yeah and novation are a decent company i was actually pretty good on keys back in the day but alas i hate reading music or at least pitched music will with the ivory fingers reading music is ez just gotta stick the notes into the note hole boom i can percussion music fine but anything that's pitched is the absolute worst to read and translate that to a key on a keyboard i found horrible thats the trick you dont do that you just drill it into your brain until a note = a key yeah i mean i was a kid back then so i probably didn't apply the best logic to learning it i played everything by ear so you brain was ripe for absorbing knowldege my mum hated it cause she could read music and she'd spend ages learning a song and i'd listen to it once and just play it without reading any music triggered the shit out of her sounds like you were a bit of a prodigy i think i'm much better at learning things now generally but i think that's true about anyonre anyone* i think you'd be surprised if you heard me play the piano considering how little i actually played it i was surprisingly good i was shit at everything else though and i don't really understand why i'm so bad at guitar but i'm fucking shit at that you should buy that and surprise me unless you learnt theory there isn't much to translate between guitar and piano i mean playing them is completely different requires different fine-motor skills and co-ordination keys are much more percussive and more intuitive to me i think easier to pick up damn son cheap as shit and m-audio guitar is plenty percussive you just gotta slap them strings yeah thatll be fine looks like the smaller version of my one i had an m-audio oxygen previously which was great but it was like two octaves semi weigted disgusting hmmm worst of both worlds but it'll be like that for all of them really? at that price range you mean? was that novation one semi-weighted? what exactly does that mean? that style of midi keyboard is usually semi its a perference thing really my piano is fully weighted so something like a synth wont be weighted so theres no resistance when you push a key down semi usually involves a spring on the key that simulates the weight of a hammer being pushed most of the mid-beginner range midi gear is usually semi personally i dont like how it feels but you should go to a music shop and try it hmmm i wonder if the keyboard we had at home was fully weighted the novation one is actually un-weighted noice i didnt look at that one thats probably what you want is un-weighted better than part-weighted? oh i see the spring thing none are neccecarly better its just preference but synths are usually un-weighted and if thats what you want to use it for but won't it be horrible to play? i might try play some funk... 🥴 you should go to a music shop and try some but yes non weighted with funk i think feels bad you wanna be able to do those big hits on the 1 its just not as satisfying if theres no weight behind it you should get a real book become a jazz man http://www.play-along.ch/notationz/volume1c.pdf yeah i'm gunna i asked my mum she said all the keys i played were weighted and she said she doesn't like un weighted weighted is far superior for piano but synth stuff i think unweighted is better since they dont have velocity so its just an on/off button the two people i know that play keys have both i see isn't that why part-weighted exists? that sort of makes sense if you want to do both? mc ? yeah it's supposed to be a happy inbetween that's probably best for you tbh they aren't as bad as i'm making them out to be really also i'm out atm that's what i'm thinking cool you on later ? yeah i'll be back at some point not too late headin back oof probs only be on for like 30 mins ish am on disc aight just bootin be on disc in a sec 😥 oof that java backend why didnt those idiots just use python the superior language java cucking me from getting free java the ultimate are you wfh or have you managed to get into whatsapp web somehow i removed the web filter turns out they gave me a laptop that had the shit installed for plebby ops people kek what ye eng and product don't have filters ops do kek rip account managers that's hilarious i had to do some real weird shit to get rid of it im so much more secure in my chosen goal can dick around on the internet excellent yep it's the dream didn't you just give it to a man nah don't they have men for that i asked and she said i should just remove it so i looked it up and it's really hacky because you're not meant to be able to remove it i had to ask her for a root password to do it but it worked lol you wot they just gave you root? yeah, she had to otherwise i would've had to wipe the whole machine reinstall the os which would cost them money cause i wouldn't be able to work for a day beautiful but i tried the root pw again later and they had changed it i always hear the big rule is always give users root access so they aint totally stoop however they did send it to me on slack in plaintext which i thought was quite amusing that's nice and retarded she even deleted the message after as if that would stop anything after just putting it in plaintext stops the hackers it's gone deleted yeah it's like when you kill someone ceases to exist and then you put their body in a tank of acid problem solved didn't even happen did it what body it's gone 😱 does that mean that ops just spent all their time dicking around on the internet so they had to treat them like lil babby children or like just browsing pol all the tim. i guess so they probably spent loads of time on fb at iwoca we had the same problem everything that ams did was tracked and there was obviously a direct correlation between the amount of time they spent on our internal crm and the amount of customer requests they dealt with so when they realised they were all browsing for like 40% of the time they just blocked everything and sure enough, productivity went up what a miserable world we live in meanwhile pete and i were upstairs in our ivory tower being paid silly money to browse reddit the dream isn't capitalism great and now petes off in the neverending day of sweden and youre a tower up imagine it never any darkness hahaha jesus that's awful i could not live there soooo i wanna make a mobile app project for learning purposes i'm gunna make a cbt app do you think i should just make it a web app? or should i go native and use like kotlin or swift what are you going to want to do with it just personal? i don't know much about apps tbh i tried but it wasn't very fun might have been better if i used swift or something i want to release it for free if it ends up being any good but mainly i want to use it as a learning experience i suppose i could make it a pwa the fucking comments on home's soundcloud was listening to his newest track and like 10 seconds in someone just commented 'yeet' i'll be on mc

too cross play init ??? why not just play on pc then cause i wanna play in bed and hooking it up to the tv and having a controller setup is effort it's never as convenient as you think cause you have to switch inputs and monitors or plug it in with a giant hdmi cable >not just buying another pc heh ok kid hnmmmm that's not a bad idea interesting current one tv pc new pc desk pc ezpz true but i'd want a small case for the tv pc so new mobo needed probably youd need to buy a new mobo either way if youre buying a new pc just get some old compatible mini one and some low profile case though you would need a new mobo if youre buying new shit actually eh fuck it products good make happy buy buy i'd need two mobos two new mobos maybe theyll send a mobo tshirt with it i wish maybe they'll send me a girlfriend with it aw yiss son everyone knows girls are the solution i wanna try cbd but vape is required for proper try hmmm this is a good regression just vape weed like a normal human being without the oh cbt pretense hmmm where does one get weed vape pods 🤔 lol what just buy a bud vape and some bud hmmm just ask harry true good shout mc? ye gimme 5 that sent shivers down my spine it's so readable youre defiantly a full spectrum something not cbd though 😎 full spectrum cool i knew youd go the most obnoxious way regular vape and cbd oil? nah gotta get my fucking cunt stick youd better not juul in front of me ill stick it in my usb port and download all your weed off it i'm gunna juul all over you and you're gunna juul with me a juul is better than a vape surely how do you figure that its literally a vape yeah but like not one of those weird diy things that has a tank and you have to manually load your oils in like some sort of weird cancer chemist oh heck yeah so instead your questionable oils come preloaded in pods and that is better i wanna know if you can get weed juul pods i bet you can because someone else squeezed the oil in yeah cause it's regulated init i mean, you can manually add oil but i don't want nicotine you can get oils that are regulated obviously but you can't get pods that are nicotine free so you'd have to get normal pods finish them or drain them then fill them with something + cbd oil and add some flavour to it or something so much effort or just get a bottle of premix youre going off the rails will i wonder if they'll get stopped in the post i think cbd is still questionable isn't it? i don't really know what the law is on it maybe i should've looked in to that before ordering it online kek trying to cure you ailments with weed wut pretty sure its illegal here muh anxierty brah anxiety* ya boi just wants to listen to some jazz and chill out forget about everything that's wrong with the world you need actual weed for that not cbd i've heard that's not true cbd is meant to be better than thc for anxiety i will probably try thc too jesus christ just buy weed you fucking digital autist can we get juuls in minecraft? we can fly around vaping on our pens you disgust me imma ask harry for the druggos then you can ditch your usb stick when you realise it does nothing harrys gunna find it hilarious that you got cbd instead of weed but i don't want to smoke weed with baccy and i don't want to role and i don't want to have to fuck around with oils stop being a pussy and learn to roll i want something convenient and just do little baby blunts ez convenient drugs greg convenience is key hmmm i had a blood test this morning and they took so much fucking blood it was ridiculous i was like "hey this is taking longer than normal" in my head looked down and she'd taken a fucking vat of my blood like some sort of vampire blood letting is valid medicine just like juuling cbd mmmm maybe i should've gone to see dr jinx i hear he's got something for feelings sounds like a great idea my man you should buy a bass maybe that's whst it is it's my body telling me that i should've got a bass idiot rip funky bass lines now youre stuck playing lets groove on key bass oh heck ye you should torrent keyscape ruined my vascularity i bet they'd love to take blood from me they'd just throw it at you it's almost guaranteed to hit a vein just one big vasule i think i've gotten fatter my veins aren't as obvious if you're bulking you'll defo put on some body fat probably a good sign tbh you should weigh yourself more ya boi is up a kilo benched 75kg yesterday feelsgoodman just a single but still i mean i'm not measuring what i'm eating i've just been intuitively bulking so really i have no idea same intuitive eating is the best fuck calorie counting it's so much effort exactly torrent it is the entire software theirs? or is it just a plugin for something that already existed? jesus so much reverb also you drank so much of my coffee you little gremlin fuck you i asked adam last night and he was like 'oh yeah, greg did have quite a bit when he was hear' i emptied the pod cartridges into the recycling and there was like 8 of them in there it's not vulfs he's just trying it he likes his reverb nah m8 i only had 3 i think hmmmm u lil shrew nah fam it had loads in before i had mine don't be hatin you need to juul some cbd to cool off i do i'm gunna need to juul some cbd on friday cause i've got to have another load of cryotherapy on ma nutz rip little fellas kek and then you'll be all oh wow this does nothing time to text harry of course that was always the only possible outcome anyway or just skip all that and start microdosing acid that sounds like a good call tbh it's hilarious i really hope it's real i might drop some dosh on a new keyboard ive found an almost perfect one what'ya gunna go for that does look pretty nice what switches will you get? that juul skin is incredible brown best switches hmmmm i think blues are superior still am not convinced by browns i'm typing on browns now they're a little bit more mushy they are i'm happy with the tradeoff though they're just so fucking noisy yeah, that's why i have browns at work and blues at home blues at work are just not acceptable of course if you take blues to work you deserve to use domes you deserve to get domed the two guys next to me just went out with their juuls they were charging them on the same usb-c dongle it was like a little juul feeding frenzy 🤠 what in tardation ikr soon youll be part of it part of the dongle the collective the dongle collective maybe i'll pass round my cbd for a 'hit' "guys its like weed but without any of the bits that do anything" hahahaha right i can either buy it from europe for £133 but it doesnt come back into stock until the 27th or from amazon now for 153 or? but pay the £20 i have amazon voucher oh well obviously do that yes that does seem sensible btw don't forget you got a load of shit at mine your bag full of stuff i know and primark shorts etc cool im waiting until youre not sick heh so they'll be staying with me forever i'm not contagious unless it's mono but i doubt it's mono it's most likely either an allergy or lpr fuck brown is out of stock gotta wait the 10 days very sad kek whats lpr get cucked son some long name it's like acid reflux minus the heart burn but it fucks up your voice box and your throat i'm on pills for it now and antihistamines get bloods back on thursday to rule out mono, other infections and cancer pilly willy poppin like nothing yep sux whatever it is, it isn't going to be good news at this point all of the possible remaining things kinda suck obviously some of them are significantly worse than others but all of them are shit eh im sure itll be fine sad vibes you just get all up in your head have a doob n listen to some jazz i have a strong suspicion that it's lpr. and if it is, it's really fucking annoying... because it basically means i'll have to avoid spicy food, alcohol and caffeine... but i suppose that's better than cancer so if it is that i can't really explain perfect time to become a jazzman complain* all youve got left is weed true but smoking is meant to trigger it too rip won't know until i've taken meds for a significant amount of time anyway bake some fun protein balls true vaping isn't as bad either supposedly and i can still enjoy muh decaf coffee yeah and then you can drink alcohol free beer pussy actually i do do that all the time maybe it is i who is the pussyt i still got my green tea my erbs smoke it ujp ya boi gotta raise the head of his bed 6 inches kek what so you have to sleep at an angle? it says sleeping at a slight angle can help yeah basically keeping your head above your stomach so that if there is a bit of stomach acid coming out, it's less likely to end up in your voice box or throat youre so good at chess my man i wanna see how many queens i can get vs a level 5 to pull or not to pull or do i do the legos hmmmm what the fuick you talkin about nigga gym oh i thought this was some goldstein chess terminology how long has it been since either both legs has been like two weeks ayylmao who needs legs thats the way embrace the bro lifting look like a triangle i wanna get better at climbing i don't want big legos i should probably do legs it's just so unenjoyable ugh it is its awful i might squat then do pull video it's like puffy just do 4 sets of really heavy legs heavy squats* then go home hnmmmm the temptation is certainly real ugh time to get my clogs on go on son put your weird flat shoes on clog clog clog off i go clogging again and go use your weird space gravity bench i'm gunna use my belt too i think nice you should take straps too heck yeah and any stretchy fabrics you can find mmmmm lycra they're just like "something wrong. he has bad" "test him" anthony greentano here checking my bones son mc? 3:20 so fucking weird at the pub ight are you still looking at memes on your phone can you guide me with a ux thing ye oka yso for the thing im making on the subreddit they have challenges and for some reason they have the same number challenge but they have a permutation of easy/medium/hard so you can have all or one of any so the way ive made it is like so you select the number of challenge and then get to choose by difficulty but the hardness of the challenge isnt related to the type of problem its just some other random unrelated challenge that is harder than the same number i mean im making it for massive autistis so theyre perfectly capable of figuring it out but i was wondering if you had some boilerplate ui guideline to follow ui? it's a cli tool right? e ye but i dont think i mean ui i think i just mean ux a thing that makes sense upon seeing i would just reindex then them as in generate some other number for them and display that unique identifier depends how important the link to the actual reddit challenges is are you expecting people to complete them there and then go to reddit in their browser and post referencing the number? no not at all i made it for the purpose of replacing a tab in my browser then i'd generate a unique i'd for each if they're unrelated to eachother just split them out the hierarchy doesn't make sense yeah its weird so that screenshot i just sent you i'd still keep the difficulty label this is the "hard" task i'd just ditch the reddit numbers and opt for your own id that's p cool this is the "easy/intermediate" theyre entirely unrelated i do like the look of 301 hard though im going to give that a go tomorrow yeah, just split then ditch the reddit numbers it looks pretty damn hard can you use libraries? or dictionaries? yeah thats easy a fuck yeah scan line for number each number has a lookup table of notes that would be easy depending on line you could just give it every chord and match them is there bonuses for making it smaller? on jsfiddle there's a bunch of challenges like that for css sort of i.e. style a page like this example image with as little css as possible they're actually cool you just post your solution in the post comments obviously better solutions get more upvotes but its more of a self challenge system ive got a way of marking it as complete but im not going to check you seen this dude http://diana-adrianne.com/purecss-zigario/ im not writing tests for every challenge i see do one with tdd but its for programming autists it'll make you wanna kill yourself i dont expect them to cheat themsleves tdd? test driven development is this a picture someones made pure css you write your tests before your program yep people keep talking about tdd on  treehouse i dont understand how it works in practice surely you have to see if a thing works first they did it at iwoca a lot it makes a lot of sense really like it's just hard to get in to that frame of mind i think i get if its a thing thats possible you write a test based on a function to do a thing then once you test runs you start off really abstract its easy game to implement make it pass and you start at the highest level possible things like tdd and frameworks are what makes me not want to get in to fe there's so much flavour of the month female erections it's hard to understand what is useful knowledge and what's bullshit ye really wanna get in to them isnt all front end just flavour of the months month pretty much learn javascript and all back end is java/python/cvariant then prepare to have everything you've learnt blown out of the water as you start combining markup, css and js in to the same files which are then bundled using webpack to make one giant bit of javascript 🤯 honestly, look at how react and jsx work with webpack it's fucking madness i dont want to front end is the devils plaything making uis is awful they all earn bank tho so did the senior ss soliders tru right i need sleep peace ✌ 🍉 has your jewel arrived yet nah probs tomorrow 1rm going up after coming off creatine can't wait to climb less weight, more strength mad tings getting closer and closer to 30s what i'm getting close to

travelling either that or i'll get a macbook air e c o s y s t e m but they're weak comparitavely cant escape it ye the dell i could play games on though when i travel which would be gr8 you might as well get windoze rather than having a macbook and a slightly smaller macbook also i can duel boot ubuntu on it >ubuntu yeah that's my thoughts >not popos also better value in terms of hardware they've got 1050s in them and i7s instead of i5s hmmm bigger number better get one do it you just wanna use it as a test run don't you you little shrew god damn you've got a search engine after you at least its not ask jeeves obviously thats what youre for i hate you plant the seeds make you think you want products that i want to try you buy them dont use them i then buy them off you cheap ffs i cant wait to see how shit it is kek are you gunna juul when you get home i'm gunna go gym and eat then juul but the pods probably haven't come anyway so likely not oh i thought youd get starter pods nah, i opted out cause of dat nicotine pussboi doesnt want to get addicted boo hoo kek thatll be you sitting in a corner of your room juuling your fucking brains out adam will have to overhead press your door off its hinges and curl that juul away from you m8 i'll squat him if he tries that like purple aki if you can your muscles will get confused about the z movement i'm gunna buy some pods on the way back from work can get them in a shop next to the tube heck ye youre disgusting gunna juul my tits off kek i bet i'll hate it oh well at least i can juul too actually i don't think it's sensible atm i shall wait until my throat is fixed i dont think its ever sensible / diagnosed i think it's sensible if you're healthy and they don't contain nicotine and they might help your anxiety but none of these variables are true rn so it is not sensible youre a variable ik a variable bigga oh damn burn 🔥 harry thinks i should get a bong but he also said that his friend sells vape pods harry is a sensible man and that he hasn't tried to vape it but he has heard it's good youre going to try it nothing will happen then youll rip a fat cloud and just melt into the sofa and not realise hahaha probably true i'd need a small discrete bong tho ill see if i can find a bilbo clone bilbo was a bong my friend had it was tiny is there a juul of the bong world? hence bilbo a juul is the juul of the bong world oof £415 not bad at all buy it i might it also has usb ports unlike the mac might go try one tonight hahahahaha i think i've cracked the fucking code i think i've got a hernia and it's giving me gerd mother fucker what a moment who needs doctors too many things in common for it to not be so weird will explain later best light bulb moment i felt like some sort of detective the stars aligned maybe i won't be a man with a tube up his nose after all if you had a hernia wouldnt shitting and sitting be agony nah depends i've just noticed another thing that points to gerd god damn it's definitely that mother fucker i cant wait until all your tests come back and its something completely different i bet i'm right i'd put money on it i mean go ahead i shant be it makes so much sense i mean it could still be gerd caused by something completely different not a hernia but it's definitely gerd i'm confident wtf is that devils usb pubg? with adam and i ? ye gimmi a min hmu when youre nearing the end of a game potentially and ill swap gunna grab food then play mc aight >yuuulnation i can't wait for you to become some oil ripping stoner why random cbd and weed is meant to be good for gerd praise the gods we can sit around at yours rippin up some tasty bong and forcing you to list to jazz the dream if you had lots of numbers that you needed to look at would you rather they ascending downwards in columns or across in rows depends give me more context it knows what you like is your discover weekly just lighthouse 8 hours of mallory knox perfect the perfect soundtrack to a juul sesh i didn't know you made acoustic sad boy emo pop oh heck ye also like so or down tbh im probably going to make it down it annoys me that its not but itll be effort make it go down and sort by difficulty probably yeah i guess fine >using this link >not a link nice one dhl or you could do something fancy let the user change the ordering or have some autocomplete thing to find specific challenges index both the number and difficulty kek got my bloods back all clear apart from slight dehydration, but he said that it was probably just because it was first thing in the morning... its just a db so everything is stored already so you dont have to bug reddit every time your blood was clear you freak so now what they think it's gerd did you suggest it they've prescribed me proton pump inhibitor no, they did theyre gunna fill ya with protons? inhibitors* damn nigga nah, they're stopping my proton pump from churning out dat acid ya bois stomach going mad i told you i told you those powders were no good for you kek i'm going to switch to plant based protein for now better for digestive system and unfortunately it means i can't drink coffee until it's resolved have to take the pills for a month to see effects maybe your bigpoop will stop now i hope not it's so efficient and clean must be all that extra acid you got its digesting your food so much it's using all of the nutrients 100% of it fuck a well oiled machine a well cremed machine ffs i've got to get one of those things that raises the head of my bed too like some sort of old man show me is it weird nah, it's just a cushion that you put under your mattress that raises the head of the bed a few inches can't even see it boring i was imaging some kind of pulley system imagining i know you were cunt hmm ill find some way to mock you for it reguardless i also need to see a dentist because it's going to fuck up my teeth apparently because your head is slightly higher? weird like the altitude or something? funny yep, that's why jack has no teeth i knew it i thought they just didnt climb high enough to get into his mouth and they would just be inside his chest somewhere i need to buy some weights i havent bothered working out this week because it just takes so fucking long i cant be bothered oh shit big weight on sale in crowthorne pick it up for me lad just sign up to a gym you mong round where you live i bet it's so fucking cheap haven't been to crowthorne for like two years sad times :( sign up to a gym it's more cost effective and you'll have much better workouts and therefore better gainz 💪 gyms round here are expensive as fuk m8 wut isn't there a puregym? or an anytimefitness or some chain shit like that theyre all for bored housewives putting off that first glass of red until 3oclock theres a pure in farnborough but thats just shifting the time to driving the gym in farnborough too and a nuffield health that's closer that won't be too spenny eh god im not too fussed living in a city is superior about actual increases in my strength i dont have any actual goals perhaps one day when i become a city boy and i go climbing if you want a e s t h e t i c s you still gotta lift heavy for there to be some purpose to me strength ye makes sense and the cloest one to me is in reading or guidlford just buy more plates for your dumbells then trek so you can bench and row more that's all you really need tbh rowing is so easy to lift heavy on the thing that would help you lots is having access to a barbell with heavy weight its mad and a squat rack so you can bench, squat and deadlift you'd see huge gains from that i bet there's a gym in fleet that has a barbell even if it is a shitty garage style one one of the top google suggestions for a gym near me i cannot row dumbells, they don't go heavy enough kek i'm going to sign up to a new gym near work tonight oh shit is it just not heavy enough gotta row like 70kg for it to be any good and when it's good it's good i'm fucking knackered after doing upright rows how do you row upright get that w i d e back boi i can actually tense my traps now its amazing sorry, i don't mean upright row i didnt even know they existed for 23 years but i do upright rows with a barbell too but noit 70kg lmfao upright row is back and delts noice my traps have grown a lot actually my back is definitely the most a e s t h e t i c part of me which is sad cause i can't see it for w i d e back some dude at work has mapped lightsabre noises to his keyboard it's some starwars themed mech keyboard the fuck as in his keyboard has speakers ? no, his compute does and it plays sounds when he types that's fucking great what an idea he only turns it on when someone comes over to ask him.to do something nice one whatsapp him.to nice link big.cummies lame babybets.gov ugh damn son i've got stretch marks on my lats wtf you're getting too big too fast it's not aesthetic ikr it's chaos my skin is going to hate me you're just too huge a monster i don't see the same will anymore all i see is a freak you can't look beyond the muscle try and move me bro this must be a joke kek wrong person but enjoy the reflected meme wtf is that i just went in to a vape shop i feel dirty ya boi has empty pods for that sweet hemp yeah man smoke a tote bag i shall does that mean you can vape now that you know what youve got well sort of not nicotine but cbd yeah apparently it helps gerd so i'll give it a go oh shit hype is harry hooking you up buying illegal juul pods you rebel look how fucking tiny that juul looks hahahahaha what the fuck why's he smoking maybe he bloody loves nicotine maybe he has gerd that's probably why he's got that robo arm ah yeah that explains it you free this weekend? adam and sam wanna go underworld friday ? yes yes excellent who is sam sam sam? nah sam is adams mate can't believe you haven't met him tbh can go climbing saturday is he big he is but not that sort of big he's just large can he vaccum probably? nice he's so large wtf hahaha i did tell you bangers as far as the eye can see do you reckon doing pull tonight is sensible gym genie guide me yeah why? gotta be on top form for climbing i see i'm gunna do push then rest friday climbing sat hmmmm then maybe pull in the evening depending how intense climbing is oh i also have a normal week end so i have nothing to do sunday oh okay cool i'm sure we can do somin any gigs saturday night? i shall look we can play minecraft tru you ever listened to bicep? they're fucking great have you just started searching muscles now in whatever aspect of your life you're in yeah big lats are a metalcore band obviously nah fam lats are weird drug music that climbers listen to chest is metal core did you send me bisep as a joke this is like ketty warehouse rave music 😂😂😂 no i genuinely like it it's chill it is a bit warehouse ravey but good warehouse ravey not like shit electronic music i see well i respect whatever viewpoints you choose to hold excellent you were right about my poos they're not as impressive anymore i'm always right about poos they're like little nuggets yes like a rabbit yep bunny currents hahahahaha fuck what also i'm going to do push today and we can slam pull saturday ah heck noice currents it's just a weird word we can climb, then go straight to the gym and destroy our backs i'm going to annialate my lats mine are significantly bigger than they were they've developed more than anything else i think apart from my chest weisz boobies are you just coevered in streach marks now my lats and the side of my chest yeah and my biceps it's pretty annoying gross i wanna try make cold brew coffee this weekend join me on this adventure in to the unknown ??? i thought you werent allowed it has 70% lower acidity wow so i can drink it fuck jesus oh shit ikr saved by ice i mean 😍 ive made it before you just put coffee in water and wait it looks like a lot of effort oh really? i thought you had to like filter it and shit i mean yeah you do but you just mash up some beans and put them in water and put it in the fridge overnight then run it through some cheese cloth bam cold brew cheese cloth? ye it's like a fabricy coffee filter so you can squeeze it to get all the juices out tbh i think a coffee filter would be fine but we had cheese cloth so used it this thing looks fancy af >a machine for cold brew that's retarded it's just a £30 filter oof this one looks better oh will you and your rampant capitalism what? i'm still going to have to buy a jug and some filters.... which i bet will add up to like £10 why not just buy something that's specifically made for cold brewing coffee because you can get a jug and filter you can use for many other purposes that will do the same but if i want a jug for other purposes i'll need to get a jug because the other jug will be full of cold brew coffee in my fridge youre going to have constant cold brew? damn big hustle well yeah, i want it to replace my morning coffee and i'll want to have it most mornings you should go the chest freezer route get one to go where your table used to be make like 100l of cold brew freeze it in mug sized portions then every night you can plop a chunk in a mug and put it in the fridge nice i like that shame your freezer is so disappointing and full of chicken indeed maybe i should just freeze the chicken in cold brew coffee so i can get my morning protein and caffeine in one hit marinate your chicken in coffee how have i never thought of that you visionary ill have to start calling you will jobs call me will plates big will with his big coffee and his big plates what broscience episode had the jaja binks bit in it? power lifter jesus that's so great sorta wanna try this drip cold brew cause it looks cool as fuck it's like a fucking science lab oh will you just need to follow your heart i know youve already decided buy it on prime so i can judge it tomorrow i'll look tonight at work still nigga youre googling coffee machines at work how is it too much to buy one from there cause i'm just getting little windows of tim ee between people pestering me for shit how selfish whelp no more protein for will looks like youre going clean gotta get back on that plant protein hype cucked by big cow will and his weak stomach indeed friend has recommended i try oatly you ever had it? apparently it tastes better than milk like actual milk i dont really like actual milk tbh all nut/help milks are way nicer and i have my coffee and tea black so i never even use it for that oat milks are generally pretty nice too i've been having almond milk for the last 6 months or so it's p nice but not as nice as normal milk imo will give oat milk a go try hemp milk thats pretty tasty i fucking hate it when people put milk in coffee especially if it isn't frothed like wtf instant coffee and milk mmmmmm lovely its grim black is so superior its unreal in every possible way how would you like your coffee? oh, i'd like it with significantly less flavour please cool, here's your bland cup of coffee that's 50% milk and looks grey dont even get me started on these sugar nibbas and is like 400 calories jesus lattes are absolute cancer ive started drinking way less coffee its great now when i do have a coffee it actually does something rather than before when i had so much fucking coffee it literally just gave me an anxiety spike how could anyone ever willingly want a less flavoursome coffee that contains loads of fat and like 400 calories and costs significantly more and i was still tired cus they dont wanna be a e s t h e t i c idiots yeah i try to never have more than one cup a day and i haven't had coffee for a while now anyway because of this thing ive found out that any hot watery bev triggers my morning shit just as successfully so now im just downin a green tea in the mornings green tea is superior to coffee unfortunately i just wish it tasted as good it's so fucking nutritious i bet theres loads of fat people that have them as a snack like when you see chubbos buying protein bars yeah for sure literally everyone i see wearing a huel tshirt is fat without fail the people who actually drink it knowing what it is and why you'd drink it are too cool to wear their tees and outgrow them anyway monsters powered by meal replacement sludge i bet eventually someones going to come up with some food thats just like a lump of gray matter and its got literally everything you need and you can just have that for every meal ever that's huel you can live off huel dont they have some warning like some people have been drinking it for literally years now i'll find the sub dont replace all your food with huel in case people die nah, it's a meal replacement it's legit what it's for damn theyre usualyl like have them for one meal a day and regular food for the rest what a future what a sub >he calls his oat pouch huel and shakes it before he starts eating! the fuck hahahahaha fuck it's so good these people must be so fucking annoying in real life ikr i bet also i've just inherited some 'vintage' speakers that are 48 years old check out these bad bois finally youve got some fucking speakers jesus i have no idea how youve gone for so many years without i mean, i do have speakers but i use them on my tv now now that i think about it i probably spend like 80% of my waking life wearing headphones or with earphones in that's pretty tragic oof hook em up to your interface i need to get one first that behringer one is shit do that too should i get some vintage interface to go with my vintage speakers? or just get a scarlet solo ? are you joking or not if you are yes get one of those interfaces with a valve if youre not no you retard ok oof its worth it though is it really that good? what's so great about it does it have an amp in it? so i can up my output volume? it's good if you want what it does yes they'll all have amps i don't think the behringer one does that would be utterly retarded youd have to run it through a head to get any sound out of any analog instrument as in the computer input not a guitar or mic no it wont do that nigga how quiet is your pc if i ran my sound at max all the time id fucking deafen myself i'm already deaf mc? ye probs gunna go bed pc is off you tried indeed you were 20 mins too late uhhh 16 jeez same thing look what you've made me do 😢 thank u hard resets thank you for being muscular another pr today 22kg dumbells on incline for 10 oof are you going to wear your tank top and juul while im there obviously are you

ask you if the bottom half of me is on fire later im sure to tell you the truth while i'm buying all of this shit should i grab something for dinner? yeah actually i have a plan 2 electric boogaloo i think we should fuck off that pool and get groggy at yours and cook ok that's fine i can get onboard with that noice did you have a dinner plan shall we just do chicken n rice that was my plan but i think we should make it more interesting cause we're gunna have shit loads of time oooh they won't be at the worlds end until like 11 so we got aaaages a twist eh im up for more advanced cooking how do you feel about tarragon so my requirements are limited red meat (although if it's lean, it's fine apparently) and not spicy (that's the big one unfortunately) oh and low saturated fat jesus christ tarragon is fine i think i don't really remember what it tastes like if you need red met meat tarrgon isnt the one how do you feel about lamb not a big fan of lamb no, i don't need red meat i need to avoid red meat i can have it if it's lean oh shit son but chicken is better chicken it is then aight i know what we can make delicious tarragony leaky chicken oh nothing citrus too tomatoes are out unfortunately thats fine this is a light sauce fuck sake im going to have to cut out all the fat arent i god youre a pain is a couple of rashers of bacon acceptable are yeah that's fine or could do turkey bacon which is lovely and healthy af no k i think my drink of choice is going to be gin, soda and lime apparently that's pretty good but soda carbonated isnt that bad for tum tum hence the lime apparently it neutralises it a bit bruh just do gin and lime juice itll taste peng af that has the opposite effect lime and lemon juice is meant to be super bad god youre like a fucking balloon man i know don't fucking remind me one wrong move and youre gunna blow the fuck up it's bloody awful i hate it tbh i find gin doesnt need much mixer its actually tasty i think you should get some cordial

muh dick problems are no more thank the lord god what a product ikr not your willy we need willy-bods tbh time to get them jabs boy if only you could get sad jabs ikr the dream also i reckon that cbd oil does have some thc in i was feeling a tiny bit stoned and had my weird weed dreams i always get after smoking i did chong down the entire thing basically though well, i think cbd does get you a bit high without thc if you have loads of it i think it's 0.01% thc did you feel chill af without the highs ur gunna get a juul aren't you huehue ehhh maybe people were saying its kinda shit for weed oil sad vibes and i don't want to have to chong and entire thing of cbd but also apparently companies in canada are working on stuff but still like what? bud is way easier to get thc for juuls? yeah the problem with juul weed is that apparently the oil has to be thin for the vaporiser to pick it up properly and thc oil is usually thiccc so i've heard that the first party pods are 50/50 and they can do up to 60/40 which is what cbd is what's thc? what are these numbers it's like the unit they use to measure the density of the liquid or something i've forgotten the name but it's how thicc it is i see i don't know it's like honey nice maybe we should just spread it on bread and be done with it mmmmm wtf it must be ironic right? its aesthetic brah just like zyzz he does look a bit zyzzy god

like an autistic person would perfect give me an example >liberal kek wow those two screenshots lined up perfectly on whatsapp weird kek ive seen her on hindge so like, she'd make some joke like about something i'd say that's something she doesn't agree with for example i said i was having peanut butter but it was smooth and she was like "omg why not crunchy" etc. (hilarious) and she'd say like "this ends here" as in like, exaggerating saying she doesn't want to talk to me anymore and then she'd literally not talk to me for about a minute to make the point to the point where it was just awkward and not funny anymore that's one example y i k e s but it happened with quite a few things do you get what i mean? other than that, she was super nice so it's weird o really you match? no i decided she looked a bit like a gremlin so i didnt hahahahaha wow did she like you? dont think so? cant remember p h e w next time she pops up ill like her and ask her about you oh god do you want me

🍏🤢 yep ikr i have already told her that it'll have to change for me to take her seriously dw eh ive seen worse yeah, it's not awful the awful thing is that she didn't know who mac demarco was or tame impala when i asked her and yet they're both on her playlist so she listens to them without knowing who it is which makes me want to cry she sounds autistic how do you add a band to a playlist without knowing who they are i think she's just not that in to music apparently she shares an account with her sister, and her sister makes the playlists but how does she drown out the badfeels™ ikr music is all we've got must maximise music enjoyment else suicide its like im in a giant balloon and music is a pump and on top is uh a big rock a big rock of emotion oh no nice thanks good banner i feel like i'm trapped inside a giant aero an aero of music and i think i might be getting a famous case of the munchies they should just sell the bubbles of air inside the aero then you could have calorie free

e|----9-----9-----9--6-----------6-----------14b16r14-12-11--9--7------------| guess the song and yes in that one capital e is low e lowercase is  high e high being the bottom string not the highest string in terms of altitude e = thinnest e = thickest i just played that to figure it out its mac demarco yes congratulatons you have unlocked the tooth gap enjoy my child nice ill get the flathead

mostly continuous sausage before it comes out. it gets its "link" look because we tend to pinch off lengths of it with the anal sphincter as the poop emerges. if a person pinches hard enough, the poop separates into several turd units. if the person doesn't pinch that hard, the turds may stay connected. me later god they look so happy stylish even look how happy my knee injury makes me > turd units

duoplegicness nice i didnt realise you were a hacker 😎 you should make it with pure css even the icons? i'd rather kill myself yes imagine the clout god css is shit mmmmm magic numbers are always good they're good as long as you remember them all perhaps you should use some more convoluted distance else magic numbers bad can you do it in cm in css? i was thinking i could mix imperial and metric but then i might get a interdenominational... you know when you mix of course but imagine when someone comes across your css and finds your left margin is 0.0003 feet jesus so much clout big clout big big clout clout so big it could make adam look smol clout so big it makes adams tiddies look smol actually that's not even possible he's a very well endowed man big tiddy ad jesus she's untamed someone

playing like that idiot what a cock muncher are you doing 95 or 98 95 make a paint clone are you going to do draggable windows i am i'm making the folders draggable atm that sounds like a nightmare wait is this just like a static thing what do you mean? or are you going to make it so you can make new folders and files i'm going to make it so you can drag folders, open folders, open start that's it i'm not going to get right click working or folder creation cba i see i sure hope youre making the icons double click obviously phew the selected state was the hardest cause you have to use css filters to make it blue cause it's rasterized icons thats disgusting ayyy look at this lovely filter filter: sepia(100%) hue-rotate(190deg) saturate(500%); weed mon hue hue hue i cba to make the clock work so i'm just gunna make it 4:20 cant you just use the js get timedate functinos and stick it in a script as a text field or something gimmi a pull ill do it i was gunna say hang on i'll push it and invite you 🥺 what's your github username yeah but i cba greg-el you can do it if you liike pull away fam don't merge shit without me reviewing push * origin master erry time just gotta raise mans lats ill see if i can do it in between whats the repo i added you as a collaborator you should have a notification it's called 'studio-website' hmm i dont oh that popped up with the invite thing noice how do you want it just like 24 hour time however windows 95 is depends what you set it to think it's 24 hour 24 hour ye is default the superior time can you also make the folders draggable? lol no i'm styling folder windows ill drag ur mum kk ill have a look i bet i could make it draggable but it would be extremely hacky how much jank are you tolerating whats your jank tolerance value huh what are the options how janky we talking? so far ive only thought of an option without any research at all maybe ill do some of that first there's a thing on w3 schools it works perfectly kek ill have a look in a sec i was going to do some hacky like need to change the z-index of the folders so they don't move over the top of the task bar mouse position stuff and change the width and height of your .folder-wrap oh shit oh no don't do that thats pretty close to what w3 are doing but in a more sensible way as in their way is more sensible you don't need to change the height of folder-wrap it's wrapped in .desktop which is full width and height okay is this acceptable it changes the styling in the html as w3 suggested show me what it does visually do you then have to position absolutely on load? i.e. i want the icons to always load top left like on windows as in when you refresh the page they all go back? ye and when you first load the website they're positioned top left before you move them ye it all goes away when you refresh push it boi oh its not done that was just the bit that actually does the moving i still need to make it work with the cursor just checkin in theres a small problem and i dont know what it means you have to set the position to absolute and when you do that stuff starts moving itself like so but i dont know what absolute position is i thought you may be more useful than a google oh yeah that's fine\ i thought that would be the case that's easily fixed have you applied it to trash too? also check out the biggest juul ever it should work with any uhh i dont know what you call them object actually can you stick in another folder i just want to make sure it isnt going to do anything fucky like do it for all folders at once just copy the div with the 'folder-wrap' class i want to make a joke about copying you but its too high effort to actually go through with might have to end up giving them ids or something id need something unique to grab actually the innerhtml could work im in awe at the size of that mans juul absolute unit oii fam you pushed it?\ soz fam had to take me ma to the shops god why is everything such a chore in js okay ive never contributed to anything on git what do i push it to master just be inside the directory and do git add. git add . fucking whatsapp git commit -a git push okay one sec i need to do something autistic with the clock its triggering me ayyy tism achieved games in a bit ? i pushed its only the clock for now oh balls i left that extra folder i made in the html in that's fine i can delete get rid of the bah in the clock too bah? i had it in the clock to make sure the text was actually showing up and never got rid of it also ye games classic dev somethings fucky with the clock but mans cookin fix it l8r how do you fuck up a clock! ?* isn't it just a script that's like out of the box sorta but it's a loop right you've gotta run it constantly but i don't want to be firing off an update every second or whatever so i'm setting it to run on the minute every 60 seconds as in it runs when you load the page waits until 00 is there's just something you can always pull date time from then runs again and waits 60 seconds it's like a standard thing that's not the problem the time is fine it's updating it on the page oh ajax the fuck is an ajax is thst a pokemon google nah whatever it is it can be solved without another thing just find a jquery script that handles it with ajax i bet there's about a million of them and they all work perfectly we'll see oof done it ez you and your football teams if you want it done with whatever way that's fine your site init what you're confusing speak normally kek i've done it in pure js but if you want me to use some other thing like jquery i shall do so whatever works and is easiest to implement that's always the answer noice i know pretty much nothing about js but i reckon that's the most straightforward way that's a good reckon i reckon you're wrong and my way would have been infinitely easier oh i reckon you're wrong you on? eatin how long? hmm 10 cool oh shit son i think i got that draggin working o shit push it up scotty im very confused it works perfectly for the folders but the trash just yeets itself offscreen when i try and drag it its the same function how can this be it's not going to get born old? jezzy jez imagine they have duplicated css so perhaps you only changed the css for the folder remember it needs to be positioned absolutely which bit ive made the wraps absolute well, just look at both classes and make sure they're the same folder-wrap, folder and folder-icon and the dame for trash same* oh do i need to make all 3 absolute don't think so just the parents if it works for folder without the children being absolute then no the only difference is that trash-wrap has a margin-top ill just get rid of it also, does the script look for a specific class? see if towkrs if so nah gave them id's i srr cus you need to tell each element apart see ayyyy got rid of the top margin it all works now push away the icons are stacked when the page loads though oh i guess thats a styling thing though yr ye you can do that easily with css do i just give them a top: left: thing eh ill just give it a go ye ayyyyy lad all tasty radical you on games now ? ye rebootin look at this unit of a lad 🛹🛹🛹me and my friends🛹🛹🛹 ive had a crack at the start menu i knew you would you should do a *clap* *clap* code review you little monkey hook a brother up with a pull request since i have no idea what im doing with css and html its probably hank jank hank hang on what do i need to pull it again first man dont do collabs man just pushes origin every time make a branch push to that make a merge request 👍🏻 assign me as the reviewer i think i did it all right ah balls i changed the name of the js file but didnt update the html pleb just push to the branch don't cancel the pr it'll keep your further changes 🐎 will review in a sec excellent give me plenty of time to do all the things i forgot to do that's banging the start menu ye boi do you wanna put ultrasoft down the side i shall style one thing though need to close it if you click off on anything else like on the gray bit where windows is in 95 i.e. clicking on desktop shuts iit oh heck yeah ye hang on ill push that now thats easy also, i'll mock up the paint ui and add a low res image of the logo n it oh can you give the tab an icon too cus ive got it pinned up top and its got not icon makes it hard to snipe huh oh ii see sure hmm does the menu close when you click the taskber bar yeah hmmm well ill just do it in the way i see and you can pewdiepie it pull for icon okay so how does pulling actually work just it just insert the changes like ive been doing stuff if i pull will it just stick the new bits in that youve done if you have local changes you'll have conflicts so you'll have to deal with that to pull right so should i finish up then push? that's why you should always work in your own branch i'd suggest making a branch and pushing changes to that right ok as in not feature specific just my own branch? feature specific is standard oh ok thats fine then cus im still on the taskbar menu even okay so ive pushed it off to my branch can you then merge it and then i pull make a pr you can just do 'git checkout master' to return to master now you've pushed ye then when i merge it you'll be able to pull the changes i don't see any prs kek i just tried to make one and it 404d when i clicked make nice one github looking at domaiins ? im not a fan of the making the name of the thing part of the domain well everything else is taken what about ultra.soft im sure thats a country soft country or is it

refresh clean cache and hard refresh fugg i thought ctrl f5 would do it i have no idea how the fuck to make this work in firefox hmmm oh it shows up with that we own ultra-software.co the dns config is just taking a while to setup b i g _b_ _i_ _g_ it'll point to that host when it's done *b* *i* *g* every time we release new software we should make artwork that's like an old software disc package they were a bit like the vcr cases remember? oh god its so digusting disgusting ah heck http://ultra-software.co/ we can make it cool tho like a vcr box but with a cd or a floppy disc nah son

sex in a wind tunnel that theres a popup on the clock now when you hover over and when you drag stuff it goes to the front because before for some reason the bin was always on top so if you dragged the folder it would just go underneath wow amazing that clock is miss-aligned still though fam kek check a screenshot of windows my man how do you launch that window? double clicking on a folder? its right aligned weird ok with more padding on the left? i thought it was centred? well there should by a system bar there as in more little icons oh yeah we can add that at the moment its just a single

nice n pixely the background colour of the light one (the main one) is #e4ded4 push your shit don't be a classic dev and accumulate loads of changes locally and then never push them you don't wanna be that guy make your own branch and commit frequently its too late bobby i already am alright your future employers will thank me should i just push it all to master this time yes ill make a branch once ive done that but in future create a branch learn the command i know it im just very lazy i think it's something like 'git checkout -m branchname' or some shit you literally just do that before making changes that's it i know wuh oh it wants me to pull first yeah do that it's ezpz i'm not at my desk anymore though you left it too late will check it out late i think i did it dope oh the folder is open by default weird can you drag it around? i'm on my phone so can't try nah gunna give that a go while youre porkin 🐖 i didn't have a pre date bev uh oh idiot prepare the awkies go and skull that

actual project it's all about image i think we've nailed that already if it means i don't have to use java script i'm happy with a new project erm double click on projects it'll likely be a combination of javascript and python i suspect that's acceptable adam and i are going to start working on a recruitment crm/ats for startups you're welcome to help out if you want wasn't that beamery adam will be handling most of the frontend in react similar to beamery, but not quite the same beamery was for enterprise customers, not startups and also they had a very niche focus on scale (because they focussed on huge customers) i mean i know nothing about the big picture also, they focussed on the early end of recruitment pipeline (like marketing, engagement, etc) but if you want some actual thing made that's fine we want to focus on the applicant tracking system side and the testing part i.e. build integrations with tech test platforms that they use to test devs yes ok neat cute but even they focus on bigger customers not startup s nice i can do stuff poorly and learn something then you can get pete to redo it properly i think adam will help with the backend to begin with anyway he wants to use something like firebase because it's super simple for authentication f u l l s t a c k d e v but we'll need a database and some sort of api to query and adam won't wanna do that ez pete can probably create the infrastructure, and then you can build out new features on it i'd opt to let pete do the initial architecture, because he's done it before and he knows what scales and what doesn't but i wanted to make a hash of it excellent lovely hashy backend can't get hacked if it doesn't work 👨🏾‍🦲👈🏾 oh shit now we've got all the coconuts bitch you've managed to break the start menu and fuck up the styling so there's scroll bars agan again* i'm just going to have to keep cleaning up after you aren't i yes why start menu broken fix fuck me i have no idea how you've managed tha or what the hell the clickable taskbar is but it has made the task bar wider than 100% kek and i think the z-index of the start is behind clickable area so you can't click on it any more i need to go to bed got work in the morning no clean up my messes funky really wanna buy one of these finally you can interact with 3d porn in your lounge the dream my mate just got one and said that superhot and

they're vr games. yeah, he also actually seems pretty nice idk why he always dresses like a tool tho part of the character which is a bit lame right on the cusp i know what they are im saying how could they change his life oh because he thinks they're mind blowing and changed his outlook on what's possible to simulate and therefore the rest of his life through some philosophical way i guess boy pablo youtube star huh i see interesting enthralling finally thats the cut hahahaha who is that? pablo ? it's like supernoodles some dude that wanders round the background of cold ones ohhhhh you finally found it jesus christ can you imagine i'd look hideous have you ever wanted to hack your memory? god, all of don broco's music sounds the same maybe you could hack your memory after every song so they are all fresh to you i wish i could do that think of the sheer volume of music i could listen to my ears would get so big but they'd be weak like my lats just like all of you you focused on size like a bro rather than strength like a autistic lifter i'm such a fucking chad you'll be in awe at the size of me but disappointed by the weight that i can lift you keep saying how big you are but you always look the same to me it's because you see me fairly consistently sounds like you're not getting bigger fast enough then if you hadn't seen me in 6 months and then saw me the long slow

do you have to do some shit jesus jesus hahahahahaha i'll do an svg when i get home out atm 🗿 find me a file icon my man itll long peng-er look* i know you have your little sources wait what for its fine i found one now youll see it's legs day today give me a reason why i should do push instead you should push with your legs not your arms but my chest is lacking while my legs will never be impressive you need heavier weights fam also accept my merge or if you do that at work do they get it you need to be benching like 20kg dumbells at least at this point nah just merged yeah i know need bigger weights can't fit any more on my dumbells is there a way to give an element like a size ratio like i don't want to do it with px or % cus it messes up on vertical what? you want it to scale with a uniform aspect ratio? ye it will do that by default if you make the width and height responsive and you can do that in a number of ways go on actually in just gunna look it up i got fa to do oh heck son viewpoint units what a trip yeah you can use rem or em good commits btw that's cool thanks bruh i want to make it _d y n a m i c_ so windows stack in the task bar as you open/close damn son that'd be dope also, you should make the close and maximise buttons actually work also, make the windows resizable by clicking and dragging on the corners/sides 😍 i tried this but it's really annoying to do but i've been pondering it today and i reckon i have a way remember the cursor change on hover too ;) 🌚thanks i've not used a computer before is that why you're so retarded? no computer made me tarded plot twist i'm going for physio tomorrow i feel like a 50 year old will and his weak body are you gunna be on oxygen so you don't pass out when you blow out your birthday candles i wish i had oxygen btw if you've never seen this before you'll bloody love it pete and i find most of the interesting shit we post in slack on it boi i wanna start working on displaying stuff inside the folders at some point what do you want that to be i can just set up a generic thing for now like that so you can decide on icons and text later yeah that's perfect they won't be folders though they'll be shortcuts to external sites so the icon should be like a low res logo with a little shortcut arrow thing in the corner like desktop shortcuts on win 10 hmm ill see what it was in 95 something like that i'm sure or an ie logo disgusting 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰 internet edge approved your pr fam nice one get that resizing working and we gucci ye boi i might just use a lil pic for that yeah i was going to suggest using a bitmap i see or maybe an svg you should sign up for figma it would be a good skill for you to have figma nuts i'll give it a go all linux editors are hot garbage honestly, if a dev knows vaguely how to use figma i think that increases their odds of getting an entry level job quite a bit yeah figma is just web based which is why it's so good i wish it was an electron application it is on macos and windows idk if there's a linux client yep mmmmm yup i me a it's not made by figma but by a friendly autist yeah, i think they list this on their site though i've seen it before i think it has an official stamp of approval "yeah good job doing our work for us even though we probably all work on linux machines" classic nah they're all on macs fam like every other dev in the world out of the 40 engineers here i think i've only seen two with linux on an xps all of the others have macbook pros i found a great meme somewhere it was some software company that made for win and mac with no linux client even though everyone wanted one and they were showing off some new bit of their software and it was just running in ubuntu every autist was reeing ill see if i can find it lol thank u wine when you got the source you can do whatever you please 🍷 have steam got that wine integration thing working yet? my commits oh what proton? poor peepo i'm doing some training thing ugh is she a robot no human would ever say that "i love being complained at" jesus that's just corporatespeak f what is this hellish radio show is he being forced complaining "about a letter he'd been sent in error" throw it away you daft cunt and just foget about it what are you learning from this can i complain to you for the most unworthy things now and you have to be professional will when i did a shit just now i got shit on my arse and i had to wipe it off i'm learning that i hate myself "learning" nice ok kid we were talking about shitting last night and adam revealed something weird does he sit backwards or like poop into his hand and put it in the sink when he wipes his ass, he's always worried about wiping it up his back to the point where it's visible what so sometimes he looks at his back in the mirror before he leaves the toilet to make sure he hasn't wiped shit up his back he's not a woman he can wipe forwards but also why does he hold the paper all the way up his back i know that's exactly what i said that's fucking weird like i don't understand why he wipes so high up anyway we were talking about how some people wipe forward and it blew his mind and he was like "that makes so much sense" "there's so much less to wipe it in to if you go forward" que is it like how in space the faster you go the shorter things are and he was saying that he'd prefer to wipe shit forward on to his balls than up his back because his back is visible/closer to other people what the fuck just stop wiping after you run out of arse i know i don't get it his shits must be so grimey too since eating properly it only takes me like 2-3 wipes at most jesus and they're never grim i'd just get a bedet attachment if i was him bidet yeah that's why we were talking about it because he wants to buy one he also revealed that when he wanks what a freak he doesn't bust on himself laying down or in to a tissue im going to bring up his weird wiping as soon as i talk to him next he gets up on to his knees and busts in a tissue that he's holding so he like oh fuck i can't wait for the next pubg sesh hey ad i hear you cum and shit weirdly sits on the end of his bed when he wanks he never wanks in med always sat up or kneeling ??? ikr so fucking weird hahahaha that's so fucking autistic imagine walking in in that adam kneeling on his bed spunk tissue in hand with a streak of shit all the way up his back that's what i said to kirby i said i'd rather walk in on him having sex than walk in on him busting kneeling on his bed maybe he sexes weirdly too i don't wanna know maybe he always gets cum up his back that would be quite the feat shall i create a figma team for ultra wait flip them round you get it its telling me i have to create a team in the guide thing oh sure i've got one already but i think it's capped on the free tier what does that mean what are the consequences of this capping as in on the free tier you can only have a certain amount of teams i think and i have two teams already so i'm not sure i can create another and i'm at work so i'm on my work figma account, so i can't look so just make one and invite me: williamanthonygreen@gmail.com give me admin rights though cause you won't know how to setup libraries and i don't want a pleb dev in control of our design files rude done reasonable wot rude but reasonable fuck i need that training on how to handle criticism god i bloody love criticism i can't wait for you to get a dev job and realise that all us dweebs do is attend pointless meetings that's like 5 hours uninterrupted work in 3 days 🤯 squad goals how do you ever get anything done with great difficulty that seems silly the mornings from 10:30 to 12 are my only real productive times and then from like 4-6pm the rest of the day is meetings, standups, lunch and lots of sprinting is that why your legs are so big yeah them huge quads from sprinting the classic that ramus guy is a madman i mean he made php what do you expect god why is the recommended style for javascript just one fucking enormous file that's why there's so many frameworks learn react and you'll earn like £100k a year not if i kill myself first tru we need an about thing like 'my computer' or something that shows a dialogue box instead of system specs it has info about the company/what we do maybe this can be your job to make such a screen or design it and ill do the monkey work ooh ooh ah bash keyboard with monkey fists javascript come out i'll design it yeah i'll do it in a bit cooking atm are they driving up adams back amazing merge you splurge i did already oh i usually get an email aight rad oh i did what a rollercoaster i'm on the edge of my seat thats so cool i love roof ceiling so cosy oh :( not for you but now you know my affinity for roof ceiling dont hold it agaisnt me was that for a gril ? yes hahaha you fucking weirdo :^) what the fuck is the context there? ceiling types i'm so confused what do you mena? mean* if you have a room that is on the roof floor it can have a slanted ceiling in the shape of the roof i see let's see pics of this gril i finally have a dev environment i had to return my macbook cause the keyboard was fucked but they gave me a new one but it meant i had to set everything up again it has been so much effort they also refunded me £100 so i guess it was worth it and i got a 2019 model, so it'll probably hold its value better than the first one i had its just usual grill do you not have a dev env on your pc and other macbook oh the one from essex? didn't know you were still talking jesus yeah but that turns my room in to a sweatbox i'm working on my laptop in the living room anyway, right what do you need? assets wise make a paint window i've updated the figma team so it makes sense and some non shitty icons non shitty icons for what? because ive just resized them in my shitty linux editing software and i already gave you a paint window 16x16 trash and folder icons oh right i must have missed that do you want to do something with the background cus while its cool its the default 95 colour when you open the page you literally have no idea what it is it just looks like a bad recreation of a windows env idk really i sorta like it it's edgy make a "ultra software" for the start menu like that oh heck yeah i'll do that do you use own tumbler? do you not? no :( are you free next friday? we're going to do something for my birthday i think probably el classico i cant wait to drink too much me too are you still in the room with adam can you ask him why javascript is so terrible what the fuck ive been trying to make something work for like an hour and nothing was working and i moved a print statement and now it works? niamh just called me on her way to joes so weird classic what were you printing he says he's confused doing console.log() is making something update or something its some async bullshit awful oh no my spaghetti all my chickens are coming home to roost oh i see ffs i did it god its such an insignificant thing too it was when you close a window the one below it comes into focus on the taskbar the people will never appreciate my art god sketch is still fucking great look at this beautiful mockup is that a joke nope but that looks terrible ignore the text the fonts are broken but other than that, it's decent ? it's the best vector based tool out there it's better than figma but collaborating in it is shit so unfortunately i don't get to use it during the day at work only when i'm working alone at home are you just talking about the taskbar i was talking about the design tool oh i see have you got clicked versions of them too make it look like this with those assets they just invert the shadow i.e. they look like the clock not the start menu i know but dont i need another svg for that do that with css no the svgs are just the icons oh right not the buttons i thought it was the whole package nope thats fine it should be doing that already actually i think its broken at the moment what other icons did you want? uhh 16x16 folder and trash can't you just down scale? i can but i am a lazy man pls fix weird tomorrow am in bed you can fix it in the svg file of you wanna be a hacker 😎😎 bruh oh i figured it out x was doin this shit but man knows about his no repeat phew nice it wasn't meant to turn out like that it's four fs 🐎 you big nazi whats the bit that connects github and whatever youre hosting on? it's netlify they host too and provide ssl certs and domains it's grest great* never use aws anymore oh noice does it just grab it from git thats so synergising yeah, when you set up a new site you just point it to a repo on github, gitlab or bitbucket then configure build commands (if you need them) obviously if it's just a static site it just serves it but my website is built on gatsby and when i linked the repo for that it auto detected it and installed everything automatically it was beautiful oooof try it out with a react app it'll blow your mind i was thinking the javascript is some tangled nightmare perhaps i should just rewrite it all with react ya not a bad idea hopefully the fine bros wont come after me mr bug eyes will find you he can see everything god i bet its going to be like python for js instead of having to write some bullshit drag function itll just be like div.dragenable() i'm not sure you're ready to experience react it's even more mental then vanilla js you're only just scratching the surface friend read the first bit ffs really why am i doing actual thinking like a fucking and idiot when i could just get a library read the link i sent i am chill nigga prepare to experience js, html and css all mangled together inside eachother what the fuck is this this is horrible is it actually better is it worth struggling through it is if you're building something complex you haven't even gotten in to routing yet and state management i don't like this so it may be completely pointless to make it into react it depends how complex you want to make it i think it's fine tbh i wouldn't bother but the app we're working on ( the real app) will be react for sure in fact, adam has already started it in react definitely worth learning react though oh no it's what all the cool kids use react frontends are pretty much everything these days god i'm just going to be that guy that's used every type of language and is shitty with them all sounds like everyone tbh i'm trying to find out if there anything that can make my life easier for js i thought jquery was the boi but no one seems to like it anymore people like vanilla this landscape is scary yeah nobody uses jquery anymore unless it's for little hacky things i have to interview a java engineer... what the fuck do i even do or say she's been a java dev for like 10 years "oh yeah, let's get that 23 y/o designer to go talk to her" "that's very relevant, i'm sure he'll have some very valuable questions to ask her" milk that last day surely it's not just you well there's engineers interviewing her as well but i have a one hour slot with her on my own hahahha what why god knows _i_ could ask more relevant questions i can't talk at a senior java engineer for an hour... exactly! they want me to ask her how she works with designers ask design related stuff but i think she'll just be like oh ffs i don't wanna go through this which is totally fair maybe i'll just tell her that that'll take like 15 minutes surely "how do you interact with designers at your current job" "how wrll does that go" done and some shitty hypothetical to go through with her yeah, i mean i could think of enough to talk about for 30-40 mins but an hour is just a waste of her time do you have the power to end it you can't be forced to fill an hour "hot one today isn't it" "have you ever been in a storm?" a storm of code a storm of interfaces so much gui god i want to stop working and go live in the country somewhere i've decided i'm going to fuck off out of london in a few years go live in the back ass of nowhere learn to drive chill out work remotely fewer hours the dream you should become a mountain man i'll go live in a cave somewhere or buy one of those vans climbers convert in to homes then just drive around doing fuck all occasionally doing a bit of remote work to pay for fuel for me and my metal companion. maybe i have a secret son that google knows about that i don't or a wife? i trust google more than you rip my son how come the site hasn't got them updated svgs fam you accepted my merge did i fuck up something oh idk let me have a looksie did you git add . to add the new files? try git status locally i think the files just don't exist will take a closer look later i'm not sure there should be some functionality with the task bar windows too that doesn't seem to work you deleted this message it works on my machine ™ maybe the build failed i'll check later rip when's your interview has been postponed to next week shame i think i need me one of those edgy aesthetic edited photos for hinge it's a good idea for finding the right sort of grils more than half the girls i match with like my edgy pics oh heckers i'll get on that tonight then i just need to wait for my t e d d y f r e s h merch to arrive then it's time to slay yas queen are you joking make sure you utilise your plants and put up fairy lights i will utilise my plants dw need a bigger mirror though rip what because you're so hench yeah i'm too wide for the narrow mirror my wings don't fit damn big boy hecking back boi do you just have a huge back noe like you're wearing a flesh backpack yeah i can fall from great heights and remain in one piece nice like a sponge a big meat sponge vintage that's what came up when i typed meat sponge in to giphy very spongelike it aint me i cant type on my normal keyboard for some reason i have to switch to the default ios one which is horrible hmmm oh there we go it's fixed errr what i have no clue i ain't moved shit yeah so you must have accepted my merge it merged but no work my mate just got this from a recruiter “hi james, so good but it says the repo has moved i'll have a look on the train to bristol yeah it's been saying that cus you renamed it i think? i'm not sure but i started doing it around then an insurance rpg that's like some fun capitalist nightmare what is

images u r going mental it works on my machine etf i guess it didn't push the changes probably didn't commit it or something you're a pleb it appears that all you did is commit the svgs you didn't actually use them anywhere did you forgot to hit save in your text editor when you made the changes to the html? if you're live reloading it probably would still update in your browser without actually saving the file i just cloned your shit and there's no reference to it you must'nt have committed it you absolute plebian i'm glad i wasted 10 mins figuring out that you're a moron back to actual work mmmm front end and back the full stack i'm not sure how i managed that i think i accidentally did git add . in the images folder went a dir up got add again then committed it's for learning purposes you can choose what you wanna do later maybe you can do some dev ops shit is rather kill myself yeah that's fine i'm happy to do whatever i can go to adam or pete for guidance yeah, you can float between everyone adam and pete will lead and you can do what they need we'll need help with dev ops too so you might be interested in doing some of that i think we'll use heroku and docker worth reading up about that yeah i actually have no idea what dev ops is ok interesting muse are famously the _best_ metal band hb you big penis monster ty wtf e d g e y 🐉 dragon yes dragon

locally but clone it again ive made changes cherry pick forgotten the command it's like git cherry pick maybe idk google it i have oh no it's git stash but that commits changes across branches oh then git stash pop god cant i just commit it on a new branch and you merge that hmmm so man reccomends that yeah you can do that as in a temp branch over stash you should be using branches anyway i am technically balls i pushed to master expecting it to fail but it did not soz i think it was something to do with it pointing at the old url cus the name changed it works now though cool have you

steal my heart i mean my semen is this still peep show mhm what exciting times for you time to use my small dick dick now she gets to find out where you live dreamy solid line she appreciated it how big are your wheels the orange ones not sure they're called like zips or something zippy or maybe zipers or some shit like that google 'orange zip cruiser wheels skateboard' or something is that them that's the right brand but mine are bigger those are street style wheels but bigger and softer they'd probably be fine tbh these are the ones i've got jesus oh so yours are over 60? i'm looking at the bones ones but i don't want them huge they're like convexed mans gotta pop yeah i'd get bones ones you just want them to be a bit bigger than normal street wheels and a bit softer you can't pop on those zip zinger ones they're super soft and massive pop doesn't come from the wheel my man it comes from the heart and tail good luck with that pop my heart i was just after a size comparison cus they do two sizes of them bones ones oh i don't remember what mine were 52 maybe i seem to remember that number maybe that was the hardness number 🍆 nice oh that seems small? i think i'm not sure 52 looks like regular street skate size i think maybe 54 there's not much difference if i remember like they normally range from 48 to 54 if i remember correctly hmmmmmmm google a chart i remember reading an article about wheel size and softness when i got them cause i couldn't decide what was optimal there's some quality charts out there 52 - 56 apparently is the most common i see i think the bones ones i had were 54 they were almost the same size as street wheels but they were just much softer i might go a bit bigger 56 maybe wild fleets a bumpy place yeah, those zip zinger ones are giant and super smooooth oof these might be the bois i'm not sure if i want 56 or 58 hmmm there's probably not much in it that's what i had bones rough riders i think mine were 54 what a fucking weeb the fucking naruto headband he must have done that on purpose as a meme for the report wait for the run at the end niamh wants to meet up kek amazing the run not that there's a full video of the run with sound it's hilarious he like runs off the path in the bushes exactly how i expected him to be will willy follow thein willy obviously is that even a question? no it was just a fun series of words to say sweet i hope they get dispatched yesterday black sheep that's the worst colour of sheep you ain't getting shit she's coming over tonight kek that's a proper mac system you've got going i'm swimming in his wake cummy wake i'm moving in after completion damn if only i was a unique person feels man like big man like man like linus is jordan doing a meme i dont know him well enough to tell

you had waffles you'd be as big as adam rip i ain't gunna play fam it's too hot 🗿 he's beating his meat so damn hard big sauce man like man like dont school shoot me bro xd try and shoot me bro close hes just so wide and my linux based editing software doesnt have the features to stretch a layer can i transform you into a vector with figma with a whole lot of effort damn dont like the sound of that it would take you around a week i'd dsyb say * a week urgh imagine it though your face so big you could live trace it in illustrator automatically but it would probably be shit that sounds like propitiatory software you should make my face out of css .wills-nose { rotate(37deg); you should edit this text on that you got conflicts bruh just found out that conflicts are bad... damn that shit sucks what is a conflict i'm a man of push to master so i've never come across them changes that conflict with other changes nice thanks np probably got unlock or something on or you're on linux using firefox or some shit it's just chrome on android >on android this dude urh dur why isn't my browser showing a web app text editor btw are you working sunday? >year of our lord two thousand and nineteen >biggest programming repo can't make a mobile text editor no nice dope we gunna go out saturday instead i think killer have you ever tried any online therapy services? like betterhelp or talkspace no don't you have like real therapy yeah, but that's for health related shit and it's quite specific and i'm also currently on a long nhs waitlist for it and even when i do, it's mostly online cbt anyway and i sorta just wanna talk to someone about other shit unrelated to health dude gyroscope is addicting as shit you should deffo try it i tried it it did nothing for me really?!? it's addicting as shit i've got it to open when i open a new tab now so i see it every day it's great you have to actually use it for it to start being interesting though its like that rpg one that's basically the same thing i didn't get anything out of that either i just get bored of it what's it called? but gyroscope you can connect it to apps and almost set it and forget it it connects to myfitnesspal etc can't remeber oh i didn't delve very deep into it i'm doing jack shit after work today well, i have physio but after that i aint doing shit wanna play r:? rl* yeah at some point well it's my pull day today but i might die if i do that from no liquid in my body yeahb it's pretty hot i'm taking about few days off only just starting to recover from aches and joint pain etc fookin long ting am hoping the physio will fix my knee tonight 2big2fast then i'll be gucci i don't think that's how physio works well, it'll take a few sessions doesn't it take a while or is the physio a man a muscle wizard but at least they'll be able to assess it, tell me what the problem is and what i should be doing "don't wear those weird shoes you freak" maybe i'll just do some pull ups the only important part of pull nah, i think they'll tell me to wear them more and stop using my insoles for my arches i think that might be what's fucking me up i have really flat feet and i've had orthotics for ages i don't think it does you any good long term i think i have even less of an arch now how embarrassing i'm going to laugh at your small arches on friday ol willy small gaps that'll be what they'll call ya i'm surprised you've never mocked my flat feet before they're very flappy like flippers i think that's why i'm quite heavy footed and stomp around all the time yeah you dont have a gentle step thomp thomp thomp here comes big foot will what size are you not even that big 9.5 if i can get half sizes weird they're quite w i d e though nice good and chodey it isn't wider than it is long that would be weird like a cricket bat it isn't that w i d e very very short but very very side wide what? cricket bats are long and then it's more like a driver sfw? yes well tv show so i guess if thats fine for work exactly famously narrow good reference btw thanks "message me on instagram i don't use tinder" kill yourself i wonder if people really do god i hope not that would be so miserable "hi i saw you in tinder and messaged you without matching" "what do you mean that defeats the point of the app?" i say this a lot but i'd actually kill myself suicide joke jar meme lazy you know what it is bitch physio just told me i'm the most hypermobile person she's ever seen kek bendy boi just like my sexuality hyperfaggot able to suck dicks out of reach of mortal men the gymnast of ram ranch they call me 🍆 wow with a few spaces that could be perfect please do show 🍆 🍆 straight into the butt wow that's a 100x improvement an order of magnitude more like gay in the butt amirite the physio also showed me why my knee thing has happened and it was a bit worrying basically my right leg has more muscle mass than the left and apparently it's pretty obvious just from looking at it y i k e s will "wonky" green i can't wait to see i really can't see it myself but she was like "how can you not see the difference between your quads" maybe you're too dismorphic already both just look tiny to you yeah i just got home and asked adam and kirby if they thing one of my quads is smaller than the other and adam said the left is smaller and kirby said the right is smaller so i'm not really sure... i suspect they're both right actually, i just took that photo and to me the left is smaller stage left is bigger i reckon yep that would be what she said damn son maybe she was right wtf >maybe retard fuck you is it really that obvious? no i've got to wear this fucking tape on my knee but id trust the opinion of someone that stares at quads all day yeah tru and no, it's not flex tape before you tab out and google that is it a vhs thetic this girl liked me she's literally the opposite of the sort of girl i expect that from weird might be a fake account she looks like a mannequin yeah that's what i'm assuming i just measured my quads she's said hey x what should i say yikes say 'hey x' flirty go along with it i'm curious what do normal people say that aren't autistic 'very well thanks! how about you? :) x' you fucking dweeb i was going to tell her about my plants but ok if you think so well you can tell her about your plants but segway in to it don't just respond to that with 'i have 7 house plants' >segway into it bone appke tea fuk wait, people actually do spell it like that only if they're retarded tldr im retarded shock i actually have over 20 houseplants how's your tomato jesus christ are you ok my tomat is fucked i've moved it inside and watered it the last two days but i left it out when i went away over the weekend and i guess one of the days it was super hot rip never even bore a single fruit fromst its loin also look at this fucking balanced meal im gunna be huge nice that's the right carb to protein ratio tasty rl? just eating just booting son o shit ill re my friend you have broken the website can't open folders anymore i've gooped i'm undone this time you're truly off the goop on this one chief mmmmm i love it when they send my login in plaintext wow was that a user inputted password that they just printed in plain text? you could get them in to serious trouble with that under gdpr i'm currently learning massive amounts of useless information about it and it's making me so angry that i actually want to make gdpr complaints nice i think its ok it made me a password i didnt make the account ah yeah that's fine i have to interview minecraft man later please ask him about minecraft i interviewed the android woman earlier i shall what could i ask him about redstone? should i ask him to draw a diagram of how he would make a calculator out of redstone? see if he can make a memory cell 8 bits what about asking him what his reddit username is? good idea and then proceeding to stalk it in front of him browse through his posts together ahh yis "oh you post in r/furry_irl huh" "get out" hello my friend today we're going to review your reddit posts take a seat * is a mod on dank memes * pp up bash one out right there i found a loophole this gdpr training lets you fail the text then you can open the assessment in a new tab and literally just switch between tabs to find the answers taking the initiative nice not cheating cheating is a part of life as mr plates said wise man if i started a podcast would you co-host it with me and by that i mean just sit and chat shit with me like one night a week for about an hour can i say the n word no i mean maybe i'd sensor it >sensor it get out that nigga sensor fuck why don't gifs work too advanced tech this one is better anyway xd nice epic that's my sensor detecting and neutralising the bibba i dont think youre allowed to do that anymore you're not allowed to do that daryl you know that 🕺 🇩🇪 is this an office reference hes black peep show hes white do you mean johnson hes black nope daryl thats very forward of you not seeing colour like that ye ik is that a yes or a no you big lame wad oh i guess we could give it a try are you going to plan out some topics or just free-form i'm just gunna find some topics like stuff that has happened recently and free-form around those same format as h3h3 basically just find random shit on reddit we can give it a go dope when we next play games lets make a list of shit from reddit or whatever aw yiss stealing from reddit just like all good content creators fixd ultra still doesn't work for me have merged and hard reloaded unless netlify is down but i don't think it's that to be honest i've just realised that i basically only use my index finger and thumb when i use my right hand to type i dont get it oh now i get it i know you do you freak okay there we go huh oh how do i fix that? surely that means i could be faster? i'm already pretty fast but i use two fingers on one hand maybe it's normal? it's not you're a weird crab man hahahaha fat ikr chonker you look like a massive virgin yep it's awful "updates wills weird health spreadsheet" i feel like thats an accurate description links are dope need to be able to move them around inside the window tho appreciate the "2 objects" touch its _d y n a m i c_ too no changing numbers like a chump for me im redoing the js atm because it was just a huge mess and still is so more features once thats done oh i was trying to do a thing in figma but i couldnt figure out an easy way of doing it and im too lazy to do it the long way basically i want a mesh of squares like this or can i just make a little one and tile it hmmm i reckon that would work maybe nice yeah just make a little one then select it, hold alt and drag it then when you make a 4x4 of that, reselect, alt drag that's the easiest way won't take long noice got deep tissue at lunch should be... interesting... apparently it's awful is it for a deep wank yep right up to my neck the deepest of wank wanks* thicc where is it just leg? nah full body mainly shoulders, elbows, arms and back then hopefully i'll be back in the gym next week the whole body pretty much maybe if you were homeless apart from my dick so percent wise 100 effectively yeah, 99.99% of bacteria doctors hate them doctors hate his deep tissue what if your tissue is too deep like it doesn't stop going down then he'll enter the vøîd ey my broski i got a cool lil project for ya to add to the ultra site check out this poolside fm thing we should make something like that happen on load of the website before it boots in to the "os" i have a gift for you too search for dynavap m on reddit we should set up a trello or something for the site so we can just add in ideas whenever yep good call i'll do that and link it to github we should do that for the other projects too ye ah shit she's red gemming she's gunna fuck up my vibe i'm more worried about my tribe tbh classic rip good h3 yeah all their latest videos are trash i like the podcast though mainly because i like hila and ian ethan is still funny sometimes but he goes over the top a lot he's also a bit of a cunt i think who is this ian character he's called "ian the intern" he's some guy they hired to help with production not bbb ian but now every now and then he chimes in with something nah unfortunately not but he's really funny i can't really stand ethan anymore big no from me dawg it begins heck yr did you see jess today? yer wot no why apparently she went on to the cafe to meet a friend figured you may have seen her oh adams gf? yeah i thought you meant jess jess noooo nah fucked off early init fair how sweaty are you /10 9 big sweat still with a tshirt on though not gunna pop it off am i i mean obviously yes this is the ideal popping off weather true i dont understand he *is* big and orange google melanotan he is big but he is not orange i mean i dont actually know what melanotan is but i can give it a good guess

want to die i know its disgusting getting on the 10 degree drop hype tomorrow yeah i can't fucking wait if it was like this for two months of the year i'd leave the uk instantly the second the month tips over poof 💨 it took me so long to find that emoji wasn't even worth it 🌪 check your hinge most compatible you've been given an opportunity a golden egg wot check your hinge oh yeah i saw that earlier i was going to message you to see but my shit was over so i forgot hahahaha yeah it's her she just messaged me and said "is this your friend greg?" ive literally got that picture of us with adam ah i see at least i can learn from your experience and drop this golden egg what have you learned? i dont want to deal with her i thought you were gunna like her so you could message her about how you know who she is and that you think she's a dick or something something along those lines kek no i dont care "hi i think youre a dick" "who are you " "wills friend" "oh okay thats a weird thing for you to say" nice 🅱🍧 🗿 😍 big pull incoming prepare your conflict if it works nothing should change oh fuck oh no i changed almost everything everything is conflicting oh dear rip u what do how do people do it in real life you cant just do loads of little changes cus everythings gotta change at once do you just drop in the new file and keep the old one hanging around use git resolve conflicts locally it's even worse when you're working on a big project with many people making changes that's why things like react are so popular you can work on things in isolation separate files separate directories i have no idea whats going on i resolved them locally but github is even less happy now oh well i think ill just give up weird i'll sort em conflicty bois out on the hub hahahahaha everything chris puts on instagram gold i have no idea of he's doing it ironically i'm wfh btw so you can come over whenever you want what's he done now? it's just a very poor dutch angle video of the rocky gervais animated podcast in a completely dark room at midnight yesterday that slowly zooms in on karl >rocky gervais my favourite boxer sounds like the sort of thing i'd post tbh yeah but chris is chris it just adds to it regardless of the content true he's like a retarded child that has his hands on huge amounts of drugs do you need to review the pull request before i can sort out the conflicts or can i just do it once i've put in the pull

noice put goals in it i need tasks for motivation i've not been doing anything for a couple of days soooo we wanna start working on our first proper project so we want you do build a rest api for the

there's a ticket in there that i've made which i will assign to you when you've joined the trello team noice accept it faggot also we need some code names for our different repos because just calling them <project_name>-backend is super lame at iwoca we named them after greek gods but we can think of something a e s t h e t i c and r e t r o can't remember my trello account must make new one i'll do it on my pc maybe we should name them after failed 80s home pc systems that's literally what i'm looking it was looking at the home computer section oh shit our periods are syncing i.e. atari, sinclair, spectrum, commodore, alto, star, micro they can't really contain numbers cause they're repo names ye i like the idea of ones that never took off though like i think atari is lame find some good names of ones that didn't take off then fam yeah atari is lame the others are cool though what should i call the frontend repo and what should i call the backend repo? b a c k e n d b o y s nice

boards flog both the ones i have atm the razer one is trash the coolermaster one at work is _fine_ what a shocker razer makes trash the mouse is good imagine buying a razer laptop hahahahaha god id be so fucking embaressed horrendous 50% damn nigga how you so slow you're nearer the internet ground zero powerline adapter sad tims aight let me know whenever probably after dinner now kk bruh mans confused that thing you sent me with the page up running is that likr just a page being hosted and flask will replace it when it's actually going or is that not what we're using flask for what? idk what you're talking about oh on ok yes i'll explain when we play game cool i'll be on tonight it has downloaded and i got no plans noice i may be perhaps nice i got a refund from kinguin thankfully but it has been put on my account so now i have £5 to spend on a game on kinguin sweet you can get scammed again ikr excellent how the fuck has someone logged in i have 2fa on now... kek what that was so qukck they're a shambles quick ok i think i can make more sense than earlier basically tried to reset it to a generated password my generated password is too strong for them a maximum of 16 characters as i understand flask its like sort of front end python right? like you can use it for incoming requests but also make it shit out the web pages you want but you had the site hosted on something else so thats what im confused about was that just a single page being hosted and you want to use flask as the actual like nah going to different pages n shit flask is a framework for building apis with python i think i have no idea what front end is not my wheelhouse though frontend is anything in the browser you can build entire websites with flask i didn't know that i don't use it i never have pete has right ill ask pete what i should be doing that my understanding is it's a python framework then* it isn't like django as far as i know i think the difference is django is a full stack thing? and flask is like a little bit of it and you choose your other bits to go with it i thought django was why you're describing flask as as in, full stack but i thought flask was purely backend nah you can do stuff like modify html and all that with flask like you can run python instead of javascript if you can figure out a way of doing it you can't run python in a browser javascript is the only language that can be interpreted by a browser i know i dont mean literally in its place i mean you can get the same results as in, shift everything to the backend and just use ajax to update the page content? maybe? i've never heard of anyone doing that some things just make sense to do on the frontend like field validation, for example you wouldn't want to query a server every time a user exits a field im not saying we should im just saying its possible sure anyway ive asked pete so i think most people use flask to make apis you need not worry young grasshopper also mr python i just dont really understand how the pieces fit together you should use pycharm and what information is going from where to where pycharm is wank i mean its not wank its just big and chunky vscode has a good enough linter everyone i know who is like a legit backend dev fucking loves it them data bros cream over it maybe it has some quality features that i dont know about you should survey them i don't python unfortunately i am frontend bro bad frontend bro at that mr css i know thats why you ask them and they give you an answer you dont need any knowledge you big weird song suggesting dummy this is very terrible will youve made my day worse just passing on spotifys goodness np bless up pete boi all bless king autism and his many ways fuck my discover is so shit this week

some weird shit 20 maybe so oof i guess we'll see young, dumb and about to be full of cum i'm actually relieved i never looked at her age cummies* thank your lord wow that was risky for that righteous 20 did your heart sink when i asked that you should id her well she's doing a placement year so she has to be at least 20 ahh fair so i never bothered yeah probs 21 exactly how's the comedy festival is your jaw sore yet i'm on a train still and have been for 4 hours already so my ass is sore my jaw is yet to be where are you going again and why i've got the what sussed edinburgh for fringe i'm meeting pete there he flew over from the sweedland he's here to fix my pipes did you bring your disguise? bruh scottish tinder popping off are you going to do an accent? of course i've got my hard hat i bet they're even more incomprehensible than this northern girl hahahaha how northern is she??? she sounds like sophie so not too bad that's not too bad kek i don't know if you got that before you said it i'm glad our opinions are exactly the same though i sent it before i got yours yeah, she isn't that northern that alex jones girl was more northern but like posh northern i ghosted the asian girl and i feel super bad whatsapp is shit like that sometimes posh northern eh what does that even sound like why you do that you knobber just say you don't want to see her the convo fissled out and i felt bad and didn't know what to say oh that's not exactly ghosting and she clearly wanted something serious which is stupid yeah because she's moving to stockholm dumb bitch in two weeks oh right exactly set her up with pete lol that's somewhere scandinavian well unless she's double messaged you i wouldn't count it as ghosting she hasn't double messaged but i haven't even read hers tbf and she did also very explicitly say that she wanted to see me again if we slept together which we did feelsbadman probably not going to do anything about it though of course classic what can i say i'm a very fair man that seems like a fair solution for everyone 💯 now the real question is did you sleep with her knowing about her want to see you again clause yes i signed a contract once you have something in writing they can't go back on it she always wants everyone to sign creepy documents she thought she got you for 3 weeks a year when in fact it was a single night idiot savage idiot she bent herself over for you she never looked at it that way yeah what a tool are you being raped violently by an old man atm? yes flap flap flap i've just out casioed you ordered a rose gold one a e s t h e t i c this girl you're currently plowing send her insta again ty nevermind i found get her very handsome yes did u thick in her warm somewhat it was weird ???? she seemed like totally not into it at all w e

seemed well into me pre bang she was more like a bop it so she only cared about herself classic fit girl the fit ones are always the worst but not post? yeah just standard cuddle and sleep she didn't seem to put much into it she seemed well more into it when we left hers though on the way to the station i'm confused wait what what do you mean? as in she was all affectionate and shit while we were walking oh well maybe she's just weird in bed it was the first time you'd met her did you dig it other than the weird sex yeah it was nice i'm supposed to be meeting that girl i've been talking to for ages for coffee cus she had a date last night maybe i'll sort out some feelings there _nice_ 🥵🥵🥵 🍖 🍗🍗🦴🦴 r:? rl* yes im on wow the speed ok rebootin liar my man i need myself a big boy email ive somehow snagged gregjamesleonard@gmail i feel like thats a pretty quality grab oof come back to me when you got gregleonard.com i mean i could host some shit but its no willgreen.com maybe i could just make up a name and find the url and legally change my name to that oh shit gregleonard.com is avaliable theyve bent themselves over a barrel for me will@willgreen.co.uk is mine absolutely gargantuan flex wtf is my number im trying to get this google thing going but its just not sending it to me huh you probably need to pay for gsuite to use a custom domain with it i have some other hosting and i just have it forward emails to my gmail i only use it for job stuff jazz more like trash i was just going to use it as a regular email address yeah you have to pay if you want to use gmail with a custom domain i think oh right well i wasnt going to do that but good to know just set up email hosting with whoever you get the domain from that's easiest sometimes it's free sometimes it's pence forwarding is always free that's why i do that as in i can just make greg@gregleonard.com yeah and forward it on yeah whats that thing you use to find domains domainr kek ironic ez life i know nice i got quoted £100k for willgreen.com cause someone had parked it to be flipped cunts .co.uk was £3 though kek and it's not like i operate globally so... 🤷‍♂ im either going co or co.uk co is shorter and looks more cooler co.uk has higher conride confidence * ill ride ur con true i've got a few they just all forward to the same address shotgun approach the classic email approach i like how horrifically slow this is that makes me happy who good £10 a year from google i use netlify for everything bit pricier for domains but hosting is free oh that seems handy i've used namecheap, google, aws and godaddy in the past all fine namecheap, as the name would suggest, generally tends to be the cheapest if ur a big fan of netlify though i assume its worth it netlify is unmatched on hosting also free ssl it's so good oof gunna do it would be happy to pay double to use netlify oh shit it just links to a git repo incredible ya automatic ci too oh it's gr8 i have to buy it through someone else? nah you can buy through them oh weird maybe not .co.uk just buy it from google or namecheap and change the name servers to use netlify dns super easy righto lol what how can it be different prices from different sites i dont understand but its 3.73 cheaper from namecheap complicated depends on their volume lower overheads upsell value few other factors check it's not a first year price with automatic renewal at a higher rate that's how they get ya mmmm not i get to guess what a valid username is now* looks like gmail hosting is extra? i love diving into things i dont understand at all bruh are you from the future thats very swish very oooo very 🥵 🍑 namecheap looks very suspicious i think i trust google more theyre pretty obvious with their pricing and redirecting stuff i have had issues with namecheap 2fa before and their customer support was mediocre at best i guess its time to go big daddy google godaddy is alright but they really try to shill you shit all the time it's kinda annoying bleh google can just have my date data ok so does it go get domain from google point netlify towards it then make the site and push to github which it connected to netlify that seems easy enough senpai uguu i think ive set everything up correctly but im a bit lost on the forwarding like how do i set the user for the domain you do it in cpanel somewhere there's like a gui for it depends on the host i think if you're using netlify then i'm not sure google netlify email forwarding setup or something oh yeah im confused about that too im not sure if its a google thing or a netlify thing if you've changed the name server then it's a netlify thing righto cause that means you're using them as a dns ffs i think email forwarding only works through google if i use their dns nice rip i think? or maybe not? i actually have no idea god knows i think netlify should be able to do forwarding this is the thing i want to do right? yeah that sounds right can you try and send me an email i think ive set it up all right but i tried to send myself an email from the account its redirecting to and that didnt work i suspect ive just done something wrong oh shit son it totally worked i tried it from another email hell yeah noice it only took you the entire evening i feel like thats pretty good time considering i had literally no idea what i was doing at every step i mean i thought it would take about 30 mins but i guess i've don't it before 🤷‍♂ maybe youre right maybe im just retarded mr email over here im special now special email you've always been special to me thanks but i actually have been proven not to have donkey brains have... you? i literally just watched that moments ago weird spooky im glad his inflection is still fresh in your mind then yep

what sort of supps? i get my protein from form nutrition because i use plant based stuff now... whey seems to fuck with my stomach. other than that, i get creatine from amazon from reflex nutrition (it's the cheapest one that comes in a tub instead of a bag, which i find way more convenient because creatine lasts for ages) and i get ashwaganda from bulkpowders because it's one of the only places that sells the right type of it and vitamin d i get from amazon i use a spray because it's easier and it has better absorption my pts photo on whatsapp is terrifying gril has bailed games it is 👀 ill check out some supps kek poor william i mean same v sad ive discovered the new turnover is much more enjoyable if youre listening to it in the background interesting i shall partake in this effort to make it better i'll be on games in 45 mins hmm that actually looks non terrible interesting aight famio i'm gunna buy it won't have multilayer for a while though unless it's on unreal or something it's unity does that have a nice ez drop in multiplayer option pretty much ill probably torrent it handle all the networking for you i doubt itll be popular enough to crack why didn't i think of that until it has multiplayer may as well torrent torrent ur life it's single player after all excellent self burn couldnt have done better myself 🌝 too real how can you take a picture like that and not want to lose weight i just dont understand god knows she looks like a blimp maybe she is a blimp i won't let her for away with me fly? yeah i've come around slightly to that plant turnover don't song i keep reading stuff on how i should probably do some stretching for climbing god i'm so unflexible it's painful why can't i be a rubber jointed freak like you bendy boi aint i it certainly is a massive help climbing climbing is all about a combination of strength to weight ration, grip strength, flexibility and technique you should definitely stretch foam roll too if you've got a tennis ball or something you can use that it helps so much with tendon soreness i have a ball that i roll my forearms on after climbing and it helps so much enjoy this is some guys "off day" workout on r/climbharder it's insane that's bullshit that's so much volume it's pointless he's also training stuff he doesn't need to train and planking is pointless yeah i thought it seemed dumb i'm just trying to figure out stuff that's actually worth doing at home i'm pretty bored of just excersising for the sake of exercise so far i've got the weighted pull ups and stretching rhys says don't do any finger stuff yet because you'll just injure yourself stick to chin ups, pull ups and deadhangs (a bar, not a finger board) then do leg/knee raises for core crunches too thank u big man rhys okay cool sounds good i'd probably do pull ups until you're fatigued then hang as long as possible then have a rest and go again until you have to switch to chin ups then do the same sort of like bodyweight drop sets same with leg/knee raises. start with leg raises, go to failure, switch to knee raises, then switch to single knee raises after that, then just hang noice i'm into that next time you see me i'll be able to crush cans with my wings nice i mean not tomorrow your cans are safe but the time after ah okay i won't get my can hopes up then you fucking weirdo his status fucking killed me did he actually use arch does * that's a hell of a last name ikr idk i think he's just memeing oh what a poser are you allowed to use your own os? also have you got any hot joint recovery tips if my joints hurt straight after exercise i ice them especially tendons yeah hmm it's like the inside of my elbows nice you should use templeos yeah that's your tricep insertion in your elbow ice it also get a tennis ball and push your arm down on it on a desk where it hurts and roll it around helps how do i push it down with the inside of my arm i'd have to be like hanging like a bat ice it is you use your other arm on top of that arm put the inside of your left elbow on the ball while it's on a table then push down with your right hand on the other side of your elbow and move it around you're basically just pushing the knots out and getting more blood in to the muscle don't ice it after you do that though ice it after exercise if it feels inflamed rolling a ball on it is the same as doing exercise basically you work the muscle and exercising it will help in small amounts lame i want to do stuff but i dont wanna still be fucked on sunday i guess i can do core that doesnt involve hanging still two days that's fine i'm doing pull today more like out on the pull am i right i wish who needs airpods not me thanks nice i like how green and black they are it makes me feel like im listening to monster energy how it feels to drink monster jeremy ethier is great i use his program oh disappointing i wanted to mock it you can mock it it's click bait ultimately just like the entire industry how would you use protein powder in a way that doesn't build muscle how to use protein powder the easiest way tutorial you should make a parody and call it that e latrr later ?

you know tubes the extinction rebellion people why am i sitting on tubes ohhhh those sorta tubes yes yes xd not just hollow long circles hollow long circles full of people travelling at high speed >high speed heh good one kid u should watch the game changers documentary on netflix it's making me wanna try to go vegan >productive day at work ehre here i can't tell if you're joking or not nope just go vegetarian like a regular non cunty person yeah, but dairy bad too i'd rather call it 'plant-based' than vegan vegan has all sorts of weird animal testing activist vibes associated with it even though that's not actually what it means oh sorry i didn't realise there were only 2 catagories to slide into gotta fit a label ? you conformist if you are veggie and you don't eat dairy, you're vegan ... woops no you aren't retard ??? animal gelatin is used in all kinds of shit veggies can eat that vegan can't it's not just veggie minus cheese i see veggie minus cheese and eggs just be plant based well, i'm not gunna do it all out anyway i want to mock you i just wanna try eat less meat i don't really have dairy anyway no more quick dinners for u goodbye chicken and rice hello tofu and rice mmmm lovely crispy fried tofu maybe i'll become an 🅰ctivist do you have a megaphone? and someone to take instagram pics of you? oh wow i did a bit more reading plant-based is fucking retarded they don't eat canned foods wtf yeah ? vegetarian seems like the only one that's sane what's wrong with cans so veganism does actually include lifestyle stuff outside of diet by definition? did not know that yeah they don't eat food that has been stored for long periods or processed by machines or some shit like they basically eat wholefoods it's vegan is insane i'm surprised you don't know this so veganism is insane and plant-based is also insane i mean, i knew veganism was weird but like processed by machines? like i thought it was just food all food a lot of food, yeah have to get everything from the farmers market even then farmers use machines imma try be vegetarian 1 day a week see how it goes see how much effort it is nice do you not end up doing that accidentally anyway? not really, no i eat meat pretty much every meal oh right which is pretty bad tofu isn't bad if you cook it so it has actual flavour ya boi will just eat beans and lentils it's just blobs of meat like matter what is tofu? also, is quorn beef any good? i see soy milk curds but it's like blobs of chicken probably the closest meat yeah the quorn beef is fine bit less flavour but if you're making chilli or something it won't make much difference but idk if you want to do it properly just find meals that don't need meat wait, tofu is soy milk curds? ye that was my plan how does it cook compared to beef? longer? shorter? eh it doesn't need to cook weird it's just proteins and matter you can eat all the quorn stuff "raw" what is quorn? a brand oh wow i'm so naive to all this sht you have such weird gaps in your knowledge it always takes me by surprise i think my problem is that i just latch on to something get obsessed with it learn lots then move on to something else i don't really have general knowledge i mean just weirdly specific knowledge about some things i also do that i thought that was normal but i think i just disregard other shit if i think it isn't worth my time hyper autism focus mmm i think we're both on that end maybe i am a bit more ocd than you perhaps or just more anal i love anal so yeah probably who doesn't amirite like pooping backwards bruh look at all them minutes 4⃣2⃣0⃣ 🥒🥬🥦🍏 what does tofu taste like? bruh that's epic when does wrapped come out? bruh u got 3x my minutes last year i added a new slack emoji that was the biggest contribution from me today check this bad boi out just standard tofu doesnt taste of much you can get flavoured ones that taste a bit more or just flavour it yourself i have no idea what wrapped is oh heck you should add :beaned: where it tells you what you listened to that year good shout which one of these is better the first one is transparent full bean kk just add some transparency you computer boy rhys just got beaned i bet he didn't see that coming bruh look awful just whip out that magic wand don't have photoshop on this machine in fact i don't have any raster graphics software on any of my machines anymore vectors are the future he'll yeah brother gimme that bean vector i cant wait until everything is vectorised when will cameras take vectorised photos? then we can make them as big as they need ot be i think that's actually impossible? maybe idk interesting "we could theoretically make a vector format that maps every single pixel, but then we'd have a raster image that couldn't scale any better than a normal raster image." if you can get a computer to describe the image in more detail than a photo then yes so i guess ai will get there at some point but the photo won't be "real" at that point it will be embellished by a computer so basically no at least you now have that bit of specific knowledge mhm i'm not sure what a camera is tho its like imagine you close your hand and grab a load of light if you could open your hand and look at that light thats a camera ahh ok makes sense see now we know i wonder if jess or holly have been let go kek theyll never be able to let enough people go do they both work there? i didnt know that yeah i think it's the first wave of many redundancies you mean until its just the ceo and he sells the company for £1 theres no way theyre gunna flip it around right theyre taking biblical losses full bull market they fired the ceo now the softbank ceo is the ceo they purchased the remaining stake and now they have control of the entire company i think they could turn it around but it will require more than cutting 10% of their work force but bruh they'll just try to liquidate a load of their assets and reduce overheads what if they cut your banana water every morning :( i don't work in a wework anymore thankfully more like wedontwork amirite xd hehexd hehelmao the next photo was of his butt... gay i mean her butt was it a manly butt it was very fat and disgusting oh fat not phat?

nah ya boi is wired up and ready to be studied while i sleep ☹ bro when do you find out if you've got sleep autism or not ? probably a few weeks january 8th is my pre op guess i'll get the results then will also get results from the allergy test i did i am so fucking tired i think i got like 4 hours sleep awful. didn't you go to bed at like 10 bruh your depth is disappointing bruh i am making something and i need your guiding voice of obvious usability sure what's the craic okay so basically all the colour pickers on linux are garbage theyre either stuffed with features that i dont want or badly designed messes so i wanted to make something simple basically i want to be able to pick colours off my screen and use them again later so im just thinking of a little tool that lets you pick a colour and then saves it in a pallet that you can fill so imagine like that but im not sure how to make it work do i want a set number of spaces for colours like the paint swatch like that where the number of spaces are already defined and you cant choose any more or one where you can have it so they add to the gui as you pick them out and you can remove any you dont need i want to make it so you can click on the colour and itll put it in your clipboard and you can remove them from the pallet also somehow there's a macos called contrast that's like this it's a menu bar app that's well designed i'd copy that to an extent why not just render one but retain the history and let them step back through the history like a clipboard using a key combo or something or you can have a gui for people who don't use key shortcuts because realistically you don't need to see them all normal use case is probably most recent or one or two ago maybe can just survive with active and undo explain undo yeah im not sure im making it for myself really i think id like to have them all avaliable to just pick off anytime rather than cycling through i might just leave the text off so it can be smaller or have an autistic mode and a gui mode i dunno though whats a reasonable amount of colours someone would actually use to design something do that and then have the number of previous colours available be dynamic based on how many you use over time data informed ui is peng the future 😎 yeah that was my original vision id have like a little + button or something that lets you add in a new colour and it put in a new ui element or just have them time out i.e. have a max of 8 but don't show the empty slots and over time have them time out so sometimes there's 3 sometimes there's 6 sometimes there's 1 eh i think people would get annoyed by seemingly randomly disappearing colours i might just let people make as many as they want and itll stack in a column of like 8 or so in a row its linux not if you get the timer right people are probably less retarded like 2 hours or something less? ok buddy i didnt say autistic okay so that can be my direction itll be informed by the data like a good little future ui im not sure what to make it look like though any obvious layout pop into your head? thats aesthetic look at that contrast app theyre bad at screenshots its very annoying to find pictures of it well, principles dictate that the active colour be top left and then the history naturally should cascade left to right but there isnt really an "active" colour from.the right of the active colour im just going to fill it left to right aren't you going to add the hex to the clipboard? if so then there is an active colour hmmmm true but that might get a bit wishy washy like they might copy something else i guess its more like a "last used" or most recent yeah either way it should be top left of the layout maybe? but that might get annoying if youre using like 4 colours and you cycle between them all if youre going to try and click on one and theyve all moved positions every time that would bug me oh shit son apple uses x for its displays so i reckon it should run on macs too thank u *nix very cool dang son macos is basically linux yeah but i thought apple might have created their own display software x is ancient but nope are there any weird colour thingies that people widely use apart from rgb and hex cmyk rgba e?

basically its rgb but each value is multiplied by 256 web safe? so you get something like the top line instead of regular ol rgb i don't know damnit william can't say i've ever seen that tbh is that 8 bit colour? i didnt know such a thing existed it's basically lower res i think 8 bit is the same as web safe is rgb confined to ints? but i've never really known what it is ye i think so wait decimal? 👀 idk google friend bro wait do you mean google rgb with floats or what the mystery colour numbers are this oh so the actual function man page gives this as an answer but it doesnt say _why_ peteyboi will know idk i dont think he deals with colours i doubt he has much knowledge of the area but he knows lots about data types the reason they store it like that will probably be some really technical efficiency shit and i bet pete will know why i mean i know why it goes up to that number i just want to find out what the fuck its called its infuriating 🆑🅾🅱 where does he work? fuck knows but it looks miserable did he send it to you? he put it in the group chat that you're in you beg i never even look at that i've got it muted more fool you you miss out on this shit it looks like an aldi uniform i've just realised what it is! it's a fucking train station he works for tfl look at the screen oh shit it's tube gates it is as well i looked at it and tried to figure out what part of a shop it was i didn't consider trains that's so weird classic connor wtf where does he even live fuck knows probably with his parents i guess north london somewhere cause his rents are like near watford or something i think i thought all the trains were on strike yeah i don't really know i guess it must be tfl they're the only ones on today i think that's pretty weird they follow me it's super weird lol what maybe they do it as some weird advertising yeah probably it _bruh_ should i just take the bag with me be like rhys with his lunchbox rock powder 🥵 rock they powder 🥵🥵 bruh where is it your parents live wells? yeah i'm in bristol atm though ah just wondering my cousin lives right next to your parents weird a very exciting coincidence i can barely contain my excitement i'm literally splitting at the seams from excitement 🤤 it's dripping out of me do you think theyve got a script or is the intern pasting it to everyone intern on boxing day obviously i can only imagine how tasty and fresh their food is to have to advertise like that unprecedented its so unsual there is no precedent check insta it'll crack you up he groovin sometimes i re-read the last 20 or so messages between us and think about how retarded we are he really do be groovin tho 🥵 dooby dooby groovy bro bruh bruh time to do a podcast i dislike the arm placement that'll piss you off fam god look at your autistic little draws for circuits and shit bet that xlr mic gunna sound dope what's wrong with the arm placement? i have it lower than a right angle normally which you can't do with it above your monitor like that it needs to be to the side the mic doesn't point down does it? the pick up is on one side so the side of the mic needs to be parallel with your face oh right i see what you mean that was just where it is when i took the picture i havent sorted the placement this seems to work well is it not always in your way? i have it on the side so that it's easy to whip out of the way and the arm is below my eye line so it never occludes the montiors monitors * what do you mean its off to the side of my monitor when im sitting and can be pushed away like so i havent really got space on either side for it to be on it's in your field of vision though if it was at the side and angled down it would always be below your eyes you'd have to have the mic to the side rather than down i see so when your mouth is in front of it you can see your monitor i haven't got space on the side though and the arm is out of the way to the side this guy has it on the front of his desk i guess that works too but idk idk it doesnt bug me being there at the moment if it really annoying me ill figure out how to put it somewhere else but for now its fine i shouldn't have pointed it out cause now it's going to annoy the shit out of you bruh i've got a date with a girl who looks really normal what do ill see is he cute? yeah jacked too 👀 your favourite 💪👀💪 you go on a date uh oh too much pressure normal date not a weird sex date make _sure_ you mention how much money you earn this is very important it will enable her to look past the fact that youve got a group chat where all people do is post poo i was thinking i'd open with the poo chat tbh oh that wasnt for you but i guess enjoy is that for ur gf you should make her scroll through it yes did you buy her a present?
